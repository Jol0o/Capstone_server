Hi Margaret, Thank you for confirming. I have already retried your payment and
appears that you have been charged $29.99. This is because you have applied the
code for future billing, you will be charged next month $20.99. Do you want to
refund $9 today and pay $29.99 for your next bill on April 9, 2024? Please
confirm. Thank you! Best, Gail

Hi. I just tried your kind 7-day free offer. I want to join. In one of your
recent emails you said to contact you before I pay so you can make me a special
30% off coupon. “As a gesture of our appreciation for your feedback and to offer
you another opportunity to explore the benefits of Posh Sidekick, we'd like to
extend a special 30% discount on your next purchase.” Thank you so much for the
free trial. I am excited to hear about your new combined cross-listing and
sharing service!!!!! That really convinced me to sign up…as I am wasting so much
of my time manually doing that! Hopefully that will start soon! I cannot wait!🎉
Also, when I have to go on vacation mode, does your service automatically know I
am on vacation and stops sharing? Thank you so much for your help! Margaret

Hi Charlotte, Thank you for getting back to us. Could you please provide a

appreciate it if you could kindly confirm whether you have obtained approval
from Poshmark to host live shows. Poshsidekick has recently enabled this feature
on your app, allowing you to easily utilize it for running live shows. However,
you should get approval first from Poshmark and it is required before conducting
a live show. To ensure compliance with their policies and guidelines, it is
essential to seek and secure their approval beforehand. Thank you for your
cooperation. Best, Gail

Sidekick account. 2. Go to the "Tools" page from the main menu. 3. Access the
'My Auction' section. 4. Click on 'Setup Auction' to configure. 5. Customize the
auction: * Choose a Covershot. * Create a Captivating Title. * Set Start Date
and Time. * Determine Auction Duration. * Select Auction Listings. * Choose
Pricing Type. * Add Tags (optional). 6. Save your auction settings. If you have
any other questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach

S. 23:51 Hello! Customer S. 23:51 Thanks for reaching out! Customer S. 23:51
This is Julia. Customer S. 23:52 Please let me know your concern about relist.
Elizabeth R. 23:52 I have not had any reposts run yet but I do see that some
were scheduled for today (I started them last night) and they are all still in
the list to be relisted. Is there something else I need to do to get those to
run? Elizabeth R. 23:53 Sorry it autocorrected relists to reposts but you get
what I mean. 😁 Customer S. 23:55 Let me check your account. Elizabeth R. 23:55
Thank you Customer S. 00:00 Upon checking, your items failed to relist because
its newer than you max listing age. Customer S. 00:01 Can you confirm if items
have active offer and in bundles? Elizabeth R. 00:01 No offers or bundles. I
haven’t listed anything new or relisted in months on Posh. Customer S. 00:03
Thanks for confirming. Customer S. 00:04 Please disable Randomize OTL. Elizabeth
R. 00:04 Ok Elizabeth R. 00:05 Done Customer S. 00:05 If that feature is enabled
it causes a delay. Elizabeth R. 00:06 Ok I was not aware. I’ll make a note of
that. Customer S. 00:07 Can you also confirm if you items available are all new
and if you just added? since when? Elizabeth R. 00:07 For a few hours last night
it kept telling me it was calculating my listing and to check back later so
after a few hours I checked the randomize OTL and it ended up populating the
relists. Elizabeth R. 00:08 Let me check the date of my last listing. I have a
different app that gives me the exact age of a listing. Customer S. 00:09 Sure,
thank you! Elizabeth R. 00:09 Ok some of my listing are over 1000 days old lol.
Customer S. 00:10 Okay Customer S. 00:11 Please try to to select 30 days or 60
Elizabeth R. 00:11 The last new item I added was a girls dress and that was on
Dec 3,2023 Customer S. 00:13 You can try to 90 days/ Elizabeth R. 00:13 Ok I
changed it to 90 days Customer S. 00:14 The app will not relist once no items
available for the listing age you have set it to. Customer S. 00:14 That's
great! Customer S. 00:14 Let us know tomorrow if you encounter the same issue.
Elizabeth R. 00:15 Ah ok. So all of my old old stuff I will need to do manually
then and then those would start to cycle going by the 90 day setting? Customer
S. 00:17 If you want to list them as a new listing. You can update them manually
as the app will only relist old listing covers from 15-90 days old. Elizabeth R.
00:18 Ok. Gotcha! Thanks for the explanation. I will get to work on the ones
from 100000000000 days ago lol 🤦🏻‍♀️. Then let the app do all the heavy
lifting for me 😁 Elizabeth R. 00:18 Thanks so much for your help and enjoy the
rest of your weekend! Customer S. 00:19 You're welcome! Customer S. 00:19 Enjoy
using the app! 00:19 Customer left the chat at 00:19 00:49 Chat ended due to

2 things: 1- I was referred by someone and don't know where to enter their code.
It's 523325. 2- The app keeps telling me to reach out for support due to errors.
I'm also unable to see anything related to my closet.

Ptbabin1003@gmail.com 22:08 I have been using sidekick for awhile, but after
weeks of no sales, I opted to cancel. I was immediately contacted and offered
30% off plus the remainder of the month I had already paid for which was paid
through March 19. And although once I re-signed up, as I was told to do, my
account is on a trial basis which is not doing any of the activities that I paid
for through 3/19. I’m also unable to add the services that I was getting that
I’ve already paid for until March 19th. I’ve sent several emails inquiring as to
why I’m not receiving my full, already paid for, benefits, as well as saying I
would try another month with the 30% off I was offered. But I haven’t received a
response and have not received the services I’ve already paid for through 3/19.
Please correct this situation 22:09 Customer S. joined the chat at 22:09
Customer S. 22:10 Hello, thank you for reaching out. This is Gail. Customer S.
22:10 Let me chek it one moment, please. Customer S. 22:14 I have updated and
added the remaining days to your new account. Customer S. 22:15 Let me create a
coupon code for you which is 30% off. Customer S. 22:21 I have created a coupon
code for you "Tara30" and since you have a new account kindly add a payment
method so you can apply the code to your renewal of subscription on March 19,

Y'all were supposed to continue my service through March 19, but it's been on a
limited account, so it's really not helping. And I was offered 30% off to try
again, which I accepted, but I've never received a return message On Tue, Mar 5,

Hi Katie! I am writing to inform you about an issue with your recent payment. It
appears that the latest payment attempt was unsuccessful.  This could be due to
a problem with your payment method. To resolve this issue, please ensure that
your payment method is up-to-date. Here are the steps to do so: Navigate to your

Kat T. 20:40 Hi! I got a receipt from subscription for $29. I have had a 25%
discount since I am low income and can’t afford the full cost. Could you please
help? I will greatly appreciate it. 20:41 Customer S. joined the chat at 20:41
Customer S. 20:41 Hello, thank you for reaching out. Customer S. 20:41 This is
Gail. Customer S. 20:42 Let me check it one moment, please. Kat T. 20:42 Thank
you Kat T. 20:45 Hello Customer S. 20:46 I'm still checking please wait. Thank
you. Kat T. 20:46 Sure Customer S. 20:49 Upon checking the coupon code is
supposed to be for a one-time use only. Customer S. 20:50 But still, we will
process a refund 25% discount for the last payment. Customer S. 20:51 Please
note that we are not allowed to produce recurring coupon codes. Kat T. 20:51
Thank you very much for that. Kat T. 20:52 But what should I do, cancel a
subscription? I can’t afford $29 monthly Customer S. 20:55 I understand, if you
cannot afford there's nothing we can do as we are not allowed to produce
recurring coupon codes. I hope you understand also. Customer S. 20:56 I
sincerely apologize. Kat T. 20:56 Sure. When is my billing cycle ends? When is
the last day to cancel a subscription? Customer S. 21:00 Your Promoted Listing
subscription's next billing is on March 10, 2024, while your regular package is
on April 9, 2024. Kat T. 21:01 Ok thanks Customer S. 21:01 I am glad to inform
you that we can still offer 25% discount good for 3 months. Kat T. 21:01 Oh ok.
I will take it! Kat T. 21:01 For both subscriptions? Customer S. 21:02 I am
sorry that 25% off is only for your regular package. Customer S. 21:03 Let me
create a coupon code for you. Kat T. 21:03 Ok Kat T. 21:03 Could you please
apply this coupon on your end? Customer S. 21:05 Okay, I will do that, one
moment. Kat T. 21:05 Thank you Customer S. 21:08 I have already applied the
coupon code to your account. Kat T. 21:08 Thank you Customer S. 21:09 You're
most welcome, Kat! 21:39 Chat ended due to inactivity at 21:39

Hello Amanda, Thank you for reaching out. I would like to inform you that
Crosslisting is not included in your Sidekick Subscription at this time, the
merging of Posh Sidekick and Crosslisting is still ongoing as of this time. Rest
assured that an announcement will be made once the updated version of the app is
available. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please
don’t hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Gail

Hi Brittany, Thank you for informing us! My sincere apologies for the
inconvenience caused. Upon checking, I've noticed some proxy errors in your app
that may have caused the interruption in the shares. But please don't worry, I
have refreshed your account, and the app is sharing performing community shares
right now. Kindly be advised that whenever you notice the app stops or slows
down in sharing, please try to refresh it 2 to 3 times, or turn off and on the
self-share feature in the settings page. The refresh button is beside the bell
in the top right corner of the app. If the sharing has not started or is still
slow in couple of hours after doing the above actions, please email us and we
will check on it. Thank you! Best, Ana

Hello Chrissy, Thank you for your interest in Poshsidekick! Here are some
answers to your questions: Poshsidekick is currently only available as a mobile
app and you can use it on your phone. And it is optimized for closets with up to
5,000 listings. While it may work for larger closets, we can't guarantee full
sharing coverage for closets exceeding this size. Unfortunately, you can't
control how often your closet is shared manually. The app shares items
throughout the day automatically. Also, Poshsidekick doesn't currently have a
feature to automatically remove inventory from other platforms when an item
sells elsewhere. It primarily focuses on automating tasks on Poshmark. The merge
with the cross-listing is ongoing, and once completed, you'll have access to
both Poshmark automation and cross-listing features in one app. However, the
merged app isn't available yet but you can try our cross-listing app in the
meantime to familiarize yourself with its features. Here's the link to download
the cross-listing app, which you can try for free for 7 days:
https://app.crosslisting.com/ [https://app.crosslisting.com/] You can use it on
your computer and download it on your phone. If you have any further questions,
feel free to ask. Thank you! Best, Julia

[christinewollensack@gmail.com] Message: Hello, I am thinking about switching to
sidekick but have a few questions. can you use it on your computer and the app
for your phone? Does only one run at a time? Can you control how many items you
share, I have a really big closet? Does sidekick take off inventory from other
platforms when its sold on another one? I seen that there is a cross lister and
will merge but If I switch now, would I have the merged platform? I want a bot
that shares, gives offers to likers, re list/delist, cross lists, and allows me
to control certain items like my show flyer not being delisted/relisted so I
dont lose my likes on it and dont want to share certain flyers and things like
that. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you! --- Date: March 9, 2024 Time:

you for contacting us! Customer S. 15:49 Can you please share your email

Customer S. 15:50 Thank you, please let me check it for you. Customer S. 15:56 I
have checked your account and both closets are on soft ban right now. Kindly be
advised not to share your closet or add listings while the app is sharing to
avoid Soft ban. Please note that it lasts for 2–3 hours This is because Poshmark
sometimes counts this as a lot of activity in your closet. Rest assured that the
app will automatically resume sharing once the restriction is lifted. Also, if
you want to work on your closet, please turn off all sharing features or change
the share speed to slow. kmrlxtilt@outlook.com 15:57 Ok thank you Customer S.
15:57 You're most welcome! 16:28 Chat ended due to inactivity at 16:28

Hi Amanda, Thank you for your email! I am very sorry for the inconvenience. I
have refreshed your account, and the app is sharing your closet now. Kindly be
advised that whenever you notice the app stops or slows down in sharing, please
try to refresh it 2 to 3 times, or turn off and on the self-share feature in the
settings page. The refresh button is beside the bell in the top right corner of
the app. If the sharing has not started or is still slow in couple of hours
after doing the above actions, please email us and we will check on it. Thank
you! Best, Ana

Hi Charlene, Thank you for your response! Upon checking, your Poshmark closet is
not linked which is the reason that there is no activity. Kindly relink your
closet to resume the service. You can link your closet in the Profile tab
located at the bottom part of the screen, then tap Switch Closet. After tapping
it, you'll see a red button with plus "+" sign at the lower part of the screen.
Kindly click it so you can relink your closet. Thank you! Best regards, Ana

Hi Jennifer, Thank you for your email! I am very sorry for the inconvenience. I
have refreshed your account, and the app is sharing your closet now. Kindly be
advised that whenever you notice the app stops or slows down in sharing, please
try to refresh it 2 to 3 times, or turn off and on the self-share feature in the
settings page. The refresh button is beside the bell in the top right corner of
the app. If the sharing has not started or is still slow in couple of hours
after doing the above actions, please email us and we will check on it. Thank

Hi Lorena, Thank you for your email! My sincere apologies for the inconvenience.
Can you please try to do the below steps? Then schedule a new show. 1. Uninstall
and reinstall the app. 2. Unlink and relink your closet. Here's how to unlink:
Go to Profile Page > Click Switch Closet > Swipe left to Unlink Please note that
unlinking and relinking your closet will remove the current insights in your
app. If the same issue occurs, please do let us know with a screenshot, so we
can further investigate. Thank you! Best, Ana

Derek P. 13:15 Hi there so I just signed up for Posh Sidekick and I’m trying to
link my Poshmark account. It keeps saying that the credentials are wrong and
then it says the password is wrong which 110% is correct both username and
password are dead on. So I’m wondering why I can’t get this to Linx when the
logins are correct is it because I am a Canadian Poshmark account holder or am I
missing something? That’s very simple. Please help. 13:17 Customer S. joined the
chat at 13:17 Customer S. 13:17 Hi thanks for reaching out Customer S. 13:17
This is Kate Customer S. 13:17 Please let me check it Derek P. 13:18 Thank you
Customer S. 13:19 Please be advised to logout and login once more to refresh the
app. Customer S. 13:19 Then try tolink your closet, make sure to use your
username instead of your email. Also, it should not include @ symbol and type it
in all lowercase letters. Derek P. 13:20 Ok I’ll try that right now and get back
to you if it doesn’t work. Thank you Customer S. 13:21 You're most welcome!

Hello Derek, Thank you so much for reaching out! I apologize for the
inconvenience. If your closet name is not working, please try linking it using
your Poshmark email address and password. If you still encounter the same issue,
please try to log out of the Sidekick app and then re-login. You will be
prompted to the closet linking screen by the app. To locate the logout option,
navigate to the profile page. Kindly don't use @ at the start of your closet
name and use a lowercase letter of your closet name. If you still encounter the
same issue, please let us know. I hope you find it useful. Have a great

Please can I get some help? I’m having problems linking my Poshmark account to
this app. It keeps saying "password incorrect." I know that the password is 100%
correct. I must be typing the username in wrong or what is the format for
logging into this app, or syncing it with Poshmark? I mean, there’s gotta be
something that I’m doing wrong or that the app is not right. It’s not picking it
up anyways.

Hi Kate, If I run a silent auction in Poshmark, I have no problems. The problem
only happens (not always ) is when I schedule one via sidekick ☹️ Not sure how
contacting Poshmark would solve this problem. Ana

Hello Ana, Thank you for getting back to us, I understand that you're
experiencing problems with your scheduled auctions on Poshmark. It seems that
the show is stuck on the Poshmark website. Please end the show from your
Poshmark account. Log into your Poshmark account. Visit your "My Posh Show"
page. Here, you can view all your upcoming live auctions. If you see any stuck
or inactive scheduled auctions, check if there are options to manually end the
show. After ending the stuck show, schedule a new show on the Sidekick app and
check if the issue has been resolved. Contact Poshmark Support If Step 1 doesn't
resolve the issue: Log into your Poshmark account if needed. Look for the "Help
Center" or "Support" option, typically located in the settings or profile
section. Find a way to contact Poshmark's customer support, which could be
through an email form, live chat, or a support ticket system. Describe the
issues you're facing without mentioning any third-party tools or applications.
Focus solely on the problems you're encountering like being unable to start/end
a live show. Poshmark's support team should be able to assist you in resolving
these issues within the Poshmark platform. Furthermore, I have added the credits
to your account, kindly check. If you have any questions or need further
assistance with this process, please reach out to us. We're here to help you get
this resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you for your cooperation! Best
regards, Kate

Hi Sheryll, Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns and we
understand your disappointment. Please be informed that sharing your items will
only help with your closet exposure and help you get possible sales. However,
results will still be based on different factors such as the price of your item,
quality, buyer preference, etc. Furthermore, I have checked, and the app is
consistently making traffic for your account. If you wish to use our app in the
future, we would like to offer you a 30% discount. Just let us know so we can
create you one. We are also suggesting that you try our Automated silent auction
feature and schedule 1 show per day. Which will help you increase the viewership
of your closet. Thank you for your continued support! Sincerely, Kate

Hello Lisa, Thank you for reaching out. Upon further checking, it appears that
your account was soft-banned. However, please don't worry, as the restriction
for your closet will be lifted after some time. To prevent this from happening
again, I suggest turning off the sharing features of the app before sharing or
adding new items to your closet. Once you've finished sharing/adding items, you
can then turn the sharing feature back on. Thank you. Best, Kate

Hello Lindsay, Thank you so much for asking! Yes, you will lose all the likes
after the item gets relisted. Yes, you can skip items that you don't want to be
relisted. There is an option under the relisting setting, "Skip Items From
Relist". Please use that feature. Please note that only 400 follow/unfollow will
be done per day and this limitation applies to all of our clients. We are always
open to answer of your any queries. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Hi Simon, Thank you for getting back to me so quickly! My concern with only
re-listing old listings, is you lose all built up likers. I would love to have a
little more control over what is auto re-listed. Just a little feedback.😉 Also,
is there a particular reason it will only collectively allow 400 follows/follow
backs? In my 8 years of Poshing…most of my sales have come from obsessively
following closets (1.5 million times to be exact.🙄) with items related to
what's in my closet. So I was curious to why it stops @ 400.😊 I absolutely
appreciate your time, my Q's come from wanting to best leverage this tool to
replace my tactics and time spent. Thanks again Simon- Lindsay Warren

Hello Lindsay, Thank you so much for asking! I am sorry, but no feature allows
the app to relist items with 0 likes. Our app relists items as per the age of
the listings. Yes, if you subscribe to Sidekick, then your referee will receive
25% of your first purchase. If you still have nay questions or concerns, please
let me know. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Is there a setting to have it re-list only the listings with 0 likes? That way
those listings continue to get exposure till likes are received? Also, I’m
signing up for a subscription and used a referral code upon creating an account.
Will the 25% come off when I sign up? Thank you!

When I checked my settings because it looked like the app stopped sharing, all
of the things that I had turned on were all off. Everything was off. I turned
one back on and a red pop up said to contact support. I closed out the app and
restarted it and logged back in and the dashboard says that I am in self sharing
mode but again the settings were all ticked off. I tried again on multiple ones
to turn them on and got the same red pop up. I took a screenshot of it before it
went away.

Hello Meg, Thank you for reaching out and for your positive feedback. Relisting
can automatically re-post old listings with the Relists feature. This feature
allows you to choose how old a listing must be before it is relisted. You can
choose from 15, 30, 60, or 90 days as the age limit for a listing to be
relisted. Once the listing reaches the age limit, The app will delete the
listing and repost it as a brand-new listing. This ensures that the item gets
treated as a new listing in the algorithm, increasing its visibility. Please
turn on the Relists feature to make the most of your listings. Regarding the
duplicate listings, occasionally you may see a duplicate listing, you may use
this tool to remove them by scanning for the duplicates, you can detect these
duplicates by checking the Title, Price, Size, Colors, or Description. If any
duplicates are visible after scanning, swipe left on each duplicate, and you
will be able to either VIEW or DELETE the listing. For more information and a
guide kindly click this link https://poshsidekick.com/guide/
[https://poshsidekick.com/guide/] I hope this clarifies your concern. If you
have any other questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to
reach out. Best regards, Gail

Hi. Love your service and have been using it for a long time. I have not used
the relist part but am interested in using it. If I activate that will it
automatically delete the old listing of what it just relisted? I did see a
button to “remove duplicates”. Do I have to push that daily? Also will the new
listing title begin with “COPY..” like it does when I manually do a delist
relist on Posh? I always have to edit that out when I manually do that. Hoping
that doesn’t happen and I can use PoshSidekick for it. Thanks!

Hi Julia, Thank you for getting back to me. It does seem that the chat might be
working now however, I'll need to check it again when there's a higher number of
attendees. It does seem now though that it doesn't show the attendees closet
name anymore…before it listed the attendees and showed their profile picture and
closet name. image0.png

Naomi H. 18:17 Hi, I’ve not been able to view my sales report for months now and
have reported it multiple times. I’ve logged out and back in, re-synced etc as
was advised previously but still to no avail. Would really appreciate this being
fixed. 18:17 Customer S. joined the chat at 18:17 Customer S. 18:17 Hello!
Customer S. 18:17 Thanks for contacting us! Customer S. 18:17 This is Julia.
Naomi H. 18:19 Second issue that has also been happening for months and reported
multiple times is that I am not able to use the chat with my live sale on my
phone. When there are multiple viewers in the show, the chat box is hidden and
I’m unable to type in the chat field and/or scroll up or down to make it
fillable with any text response. This has caused me to lose potential sales.
I’ve had to search them on PM to answer their questions and often it is too late
to capture that interest… Naomi H. 18:20 Would really like some sort of solution
to both of these issues Customer S. 18:23 Upon checking, your sales report is
viewable. Can you please try to check it again on your app? Go to tools and
click view sales report. Customer S. 18:24 Regarding your concern about
comments, I will raise this to our technical team. Naomi H. 18:24 It’s been
raised to the technical team multiple times since last year :( Naomi H. 18:24
I’ll check the sales report… Naomi H. 18:25 If I exit this chat will I lose our
connection? Customer S. 18:25 I'm sorry to hear that, but the issue has been
resolved. Naomi H. 18:25 Which issue? Naomi H. 18:26 The sales report issue or
the chat issue? Customer S. 18:26 The sales report Customer S. 18:26 You can
minimize the chat so you can check your sales report. Naomi H. 18:27 Would you
like me to send you a screenshot of the sales report? Customer S. 18:27 Yes
please. Naomi H. 18:27 It does not show any stats Naomi H. 18:27 Ok one moment
Customer S. 18:27 Sure, take your time. Naomi H. 18:28 photo.jpeg 56.2 KB

Naomi H. 18:28 It only shows number of sales and revenue but no provincial sales
stats Customer S. 18:30 You have to click the map which states that you would
like to view. Customer S. 18:31 Let me know if you're able to view it. Customer
S. 18:31 Also, may I ask when was the last time you have updated your app? Naomi
H. 18:34 Ok, I can click on the province and see the sales. Previously though,
there used to be a $ value linked to each province on the map that you could
view at a glance and didn’t have to click each province individually. Has that
changed? Naomi H. 18:34 I updated it with the last most recent update. It says
it’s up to date. Customer S. 18:38 Can you please confirm the updated version
you have on your phone? Customer S. 18:38 I suggest reinstalling the app. We
have updated it last week. Naomi H. 18:39 1.33 Naomi H. 18:39 Is there an update
since that one? Customer S. 18:40 Are you an android or ios? Naomi H. 18:40 iOS
Customer S. 18:41 Yes, you're on an updated version. Naomi H. 18:41 Ok… Naomi H.
18:42 Just a note that I started reporting the chat issue back in October
2023….its been escalated multiple times. Any idea on the timeline for this fix.
5 months is a long time to wait… Customer S. 18:43 Let me ask a follow up about
it. Naomi H. 18:43 Thank you. So then for the sales report, should I no longer
see the $ value within the map? Customer S. 18:44 Have you tried scheduling a
new show since last October? Naomi H. 18:44 Yes, I’ve been running them weekly
Customer S. 18:45 And you still have the same experience? Naomi H. 18:45 Yes
Customer S. 18:45 Did you schedule your show through Poshsidekick app? Naomi H.
18:45 Yes Customer S. 18:46 Okay, thanks for the confirmation. Customer S. 18:46
I will make sure to ask an update regarding with your issue. Customer S. 18:47
So then for the sales report, should I no longer see the $ value within the map?
Please try to resync your sales report Naomi H. 18:47 I tried that again last
week. I can try again… Customer S. 18:47 Let me know if you still encounter the
same so I can also include it to my report. Customer S. 18:47 Sure. Naomi H.
18:48 I’ll let you know in about 30 mins if it’s any different. Customer S.
18:49 Sure, you can email us and include the screenshot. Naomi H. 18:50 I really
do hope the chat situation can be resolved soon. Naomi H. 18:51 Sure, what is
the email? Customer S. 18:52 support@poshsidekick.com [support@poshsidekick.com]

Hi Jennifer, Thank you for your email! Kindly be aware that it's not the entire
women category, what we meant is the customize category that you have created
and named as "No discounts". It is in your My Categories section which is under
Tools tab. I suggest following the below steps: 1. Click on Tools Tab (bottom
part of the screen) 2. Tap My Categories, then click on the customize category
"No Discounts" 3. Check if the items are there, and you will also see that you
have selected "Women" under Departments Then after checking, and confirming if
there are items are included there you can proceed checking in your offers
setting. 1. Go to Settings Page 2. Scroll down to Offers section 3. Under Offer
Filters, you will see "No discounts", just above "Add Offer Rules For My
Category" 4. Click on the "No Discounts", then you'll see that you have made an
exception for it and enabled the "Do not send OTL for this category" feature. I
suggest deleting the customized category of "No discounts" that you have
created, and utilize the offer filter which is "Add offer rules for specific
items" instead for items that you don't want the app to send an offer. Thank
you! Kind regards, Ana

Thank you for replying. Are items I list automatically being put into the "do

Generally speaking, items I price at $10 or under are the items I put in the "do
not send discount" category.

Hi Jennifer, Thank you for patiently waiting! Upon hearing back from our
Technical Team, they have investigated the issue and noticed that the item you
have provided is included in the category that you created with a name "No
discount". Then, on the setting of your offers to likers you have selected this
category "No discount" to "Do not send an OTL for this category" on the offer
filters, that's the reason why no offers were being sent. Please be advised to
double check your My Categories in the Tools tab, to make sure that those items
are not included there, so that the app can send offers. Thank you! Kind

Thank you for your reply and help. I turned off the "randomize relist and OTL"
as you suggested. To my knowledge, I have always had that feature "on" and did
not have issues with offers not being sent to new likers. I will see how this
goes and contact you again if I am still having the same problem. Thanks again!

Hello Jennifer, Thank you for reaching out! I understand you’re having some
concerns about the offer settings. Let me clarify how it works. The 15-minute
interval setting means that the app checks every 15 minutes to see if there are
any new likes and sends out offers accordingly. So, it’s possible that a like
could have happened just a minute ago, and an offer was sent out because the
15-minute interval had just ended. If you’re noticing that most items with new
likes are not receiving offers, it might be helpful to adjust your settings. We
suggest disabling the ‘Randomized OTL’ and ‘Relist’ options and adding a
randomized delay of 1-15 minutes to the normal ‘OTL’ and ‘Relisting’ times. This
should help ensure that offers are sent out more consistently to new likers. If
you continue to experience issues or have any other questions, please don’t
hesitate to reach out. kind regards, Mary

Hi! I'm hoping you can help me. I have my sidekick account set to offer a
specified discount to likers after 15 minutes. Today I have noticed that some
offers were sent to likers but it most items with new likes are not receiving
offers. Can you please tell me why offers aren't being sent to new likers? Do I
have a setting that needs to be undone? Thank you so much for your help.

Hi! I only cancelled because I needed to add a second closet. There was no way
to do it other than cancelling and resubscribing. I would suggest an easier
process to add a second closet. When you initially subscribe it gives you the
slider bar to pick how many closets but once you subscribe with one closet that
bar goes away and there is never an option to add more closets. By the way I
resubscribed right after I cancelled! Thanks! Amy

have per auction.? Of say 50 items. Customer S. 17:09 Here's the credit

anything in your promotions saying it was necessary to buy credits on top of the
$29.99 per month fee. Is there anywhere that gives detailed explanation of all
your services and associated fees? Customer S. 17:17 Please join our Facebook
page for all of our announcements, regarding the new features and changes.

Hi Shannon, Thank you for reaching out. I'm so sorry to hear that. In order to
resolve this issue. You need to unlink your closet and then relink it. Please
note that unlinking and relinking your closet will remove the current insights
in your app. Once that’s done, turn off the self-share feature and create a new
closet snapshot on the app. Thank you. Best, Kate

Hello, I cannot stay logged in to your service. It completely logs me out and
then I have to add my closet and payment all over again. It's horrible. I also
don't want to be charged for it multiple times per month. It didn't do that most
of the time I used it but for the past week it has, so your app was more hassle
than what it was worth. Maybe I'll try again next year to see if you've improved
it. Thank you, Shannon

sharing your honest reason, and we respect your decision. Here's how to unlink
your closet: Go to Profile Page > Click Switch Closet > Swipe left to Unlink
Stephanie P. 14:41 Ok and then I can go back in to cancel membership and that
will cancel everything for me Customer S. 14:41 If you ever decide to use the
app again, please feel free to contact us and we will be more than happy to give
you an exclusive discount. Customer S. 14:41 Yes, that's correct. Stephanie P.

This is the 2nd time I've tried it and I tried using the features more this time
to see if it made a difference in sales but unfortunately it didn't. Lots of
traffic, ridiculously underpriced compared to other sellers and still not
budging.

Hello Stephanie, I understand your concern and I’m here to help. If you’ve
relinked your closet and the service still appears inactive, please try
refreshing the app. Here’s how: 1. Log out of the app. 2. Close the app
completely. 3. Reopen the app. 4. Log back in. This should help reactivate your
service. If you continue to experience issues, please let us know and we’ll
assist you further. Kind regards, Mary

Hello, I have noticed a $14.99 network shares on my account. I have not
re-activated it, so was wondering why did it come back? I used it back in the
fall, but then asked to be taken off of it, because I was not listing much. At
this point, I am still not listing much due to health issues, so could you
please take that charge off my account and stop that feature, (if it's on
somehow?). When would Posh sidekick offer the cross listing? I saw an
announcement of a video, but didn't get to watch it. Where can I get more info
on that offer? I still have Vendoo and with me not listing anything, I need to
look at what is essential and what is not right now. Thank you, Aleksandra

Hi Kate, I understand your response re 7-9K shares, but that should not account
for 12 hours with NO SHARING at all, nor for any hours with NO shares at all.
Can you explain the reason for that or forward my concerns to someone who can.
Thank you, Sandra Moran

Hi Sandy, Thanks for reaching out. Upon further checking, with your share speed
being fast, you will receive up to 9k shares. Please be aware that it won't
always hit 9k, in fact, 9k shares is the maximum. Usually, it will be between
7-9k shares including self-shares, community shares, party shares, share back
per day. Furthermore, I have checked, and the app is consistently making traffic
for your account. Thank you. Best, Kate

﻿Hi again, I don’t mean to be picky, but yesterday I wrote re 4, 7, 10 & 16 hour
time lapses when it seemed nothing in my closet was being shared. Today, at just
after 12 noon, I looked & it showed my closet had not been shared for 12 hours.
I understand less sharing during night hours I guess, but POSHMARK is viewed
from many time zones so how is it my closet was again not shared for 12 HOURS???
Please let me know what the issue is with this. I feel like I have to
“helicopter” Sidekick & I shouldn’t have to. I do not like feeling that I cannot
relax & depend on it. I had to take a hiatus for 5-6 weeks due to an accident I
had so I anticipate it will take some time for me to “catch up” & the small
profit I may have made barely pays for Sidekick. Would you please explain to me
how the app shares at different times of the day even when set on FAST. I used
to adjust the share speed at night, slowing it down, but now I’m unsure what to
do. Thank you for any input you can give me to help me better understand the
system. I am pretty nerdy re technology, use only a phone, but these hours of no
sharing are discouraging. Thanks again, Sandy Moran

Hi Vi, Thank you for informing us! Upon checking, your account was on Soft Ban.
Please don't share your closet or add listings while the app is sharing to avoid
a Soft ban. Kindly note that it lasts for 2–3 hours This is because Poshmark
sometimes counts this as a lot of activity in your closet. Rest assured that the
app will automatically resume in sharing once the restriction is lifted. To
prevent this from happening again, I suggest turning off the app's sharing
features or changing the share speed to slow, before sharing or adding new items
to your closet. Once you've finished sharing/adding items, you can turn the
sharing feature back on or your share speed. Thank you! Best, Ana

Hello Joni, Thank you so much for reaching out! Upon checking, you are currently
on a soft ban. Please keep in mind that it lasts for about 2-3 hours. To avoid a
soft ban, do not share your closet or add listings while the app is sharing.
This is because Poshmark sometimes considers this to be a high level of activity
in your closet. Please avoid using two sharing services at the same time. Rest
assured that the app will automatically resume sharing once the restriction is
lifted. Also, if you want to work on your closet, please disable all sharing
features to avoid this. I really hope you understand. Have a great day! Best
Regards, Simon

Hi Lisa, Thanks for reaching out. Please be advised to unlink and relink your
closet before you do a closet snapshot. Here's how to use Closet Snapshot:
• Turn "Self Share" OFF. • Organize your closet manually by sharing each item
one by one until it's in the order you prefer. • Once your closet is organized,
go back to Posh Sidekick and click on "Closet Snapshot". • Under "Share
Options", select "Share in reverse". From now on, every time there's a share
session, your closet will share in the order you selected. If your closet gets
jumbled for any reason, there's a button next to the Closet Snapshot button
labeled “Put Your Closet Back in Order". Clicking this button will give you the
option to: • Continue sharing throughout the day. • Be notified via push
notification when the process is completed. After the notification, sharing will
stop until you turn it back on. It's important to note that once you select what
to do after putting your closet back in order, the process will begin
immediately and cannot be stopped until it's complete. We hope this helps. Best,
Kate

I contacted you last week because I had for the first time 3 listings that had
either sold or were turned to not available and when you relisted you picked
them up and made a new active listing. I turned off your send offer to likers
and relisting fuctions and did a complete inventory against posh and got rid of
one's turned back to active and also revamped 100s of my old listings. I want to
know if you can take a snap shot of what me closet looks like today so I can
restart these functions. From now on I will blacklist items I have sold from the
relist fuction.

of our cross-listing app, but we’re taking it to the next level. We’re merging
it with Posh Sidekick to create a single, powerful platform that we believe will
be unbeatable in the market. This merger will combine the best features of both
apps, providing a seamless and superior user experience. We’re confident that
this will revolutionize the way our users interact with our platform and each
other. Here's what's in it for you: We’d like to offer you a two-week,
no-strings-attached trial of Posh Sidekick. You can try it out, and see how it
fits with your brand, and there’s no charge at all during this period. If you
find it’s a good match, we’d be happy to discuss a paid collaboration. All we
need is your media kit to get started! As part of our collaboration, we offer a
25% commission on the first purchase made by any of your referrals. And if they
subscribe, you’ll earn from that too! Plus, there’s an easy way to earn: for
every free trial sign-up using your unique code, you’ll make $0.50. It’s as
simple as that! Warm regards, Mary

Hi Wendy, We are grateful for your efforts in promoting the Posh Sidekick app
through your videos. However, we've noticed that both videos feature the same
content, which might be the reason we are not seeing new users coming from your
videos. To enhance the impact of your promotions, could you please include some
tangible examples of how Posh Sidekick has boosted your sales? Sharing personal
success stories can be very persuasive. Additionally, highlighting different
features in each video could showcase the app's versatility and appeal to a
broader audience. We understand that building a strong referral base can take
time, and we want to support you in this journey. Therefore, we're extending our
collaboration for another month, giving us more time to work together and
achieve our shared goals. We're excited to see the fresh content you'll create
and are confident in your ability to convey the benefits of Posh Sidekick
effectively. Warm regards, Mary

Hi Mary, Please find our media kit and a screenshot showing our recent YouTube
metrics. Our channel has been growing steadily and we also have a strong base of
returning viewers. Our viewers are a mix of both men and women. Seventy-five
percent live in the US. We have viewers worldwide but the majority of the
remaining 25% reside in Canada, UK and Australia. We are currently producing
about 5 videos a month. This is down from our previous schedule of 8-10 a month
and is due to family issues that have temporarily diverted our attention away
from YouTube. We are slowly building back up to our original posting schedule
and hope to be back in full swing by Fall 2024. Please let me know if you have

Hi there, We are so impressed with Posh Sidekick so far. It is a total workhorse
and has allowed me to focus on other things while Sidekick does the heavy
lifting. Thanks for adding the auction credits. I've been on the waitlist for a
bit to do Posh shows. Hopefully that will get approved soon so I can give the
silent shows a go. (We are also introducing live selling to our audience on
other apps and hoping we can pair that with Posh around the same time.) Lots
going on around here and we are having so much fun with it! Thanks for being
part of it. :) Wendy Williamson Nina's Jewels

Hello Wendy, Thank you for bringing this to our attention, I’m sorry to hear
that you’re having trouble linking your Poshmark account to the Sidekick app.
Our app is designed to be used on a mobile device, so please ensure you’re
accessing it on your phone. Here’s how you can link your Poshmark account: 1.
Open the Sidekick app and go to the Profile button at the bottom of the screen.
2. Tap Switch Closet. You should see a “+” button at the lower part of the
screen. 3. Tap the “+” button and enter your Poshmark closet name. Please note
that you should not include the “@” symbol and type it in all lowercase letters.
If you’re not seeing the “+” sign in the Sidekick app, it might help to refresh
the app. Log out and then back in the app. This should refresh the app and
hopefully, the “+” sign will appear. If you’re still having trouble after
following these steps, please let us know. We’re here to help! Kind regards,
Mary

to link my Poshmark account. We login to Poshmark through our Google account and
I can't seem to figure out how connect my Poshmark account on Sidekick with that
login. Let me know what I'm doing wrong. Wendy Williamson Nina's Jewels

Hi Mary, I truly apologize for the long delay. Our daughter was hospitalized for
quite some time due to a rare and scary incident that doctors believe was a
reaction to one of her epilepsy medications used for treating her seizures.
Since she had to suddenly stop that medication (typically that is not
recommended and it should be tapered off) and since she was still experiencing
severe symptoms, they hospitalized her while her symptoms abated, and while she
started new epilepsy meds. Her symptoms included severely swollen joints, a
rash, and extreme pain in her hands and feet. She couldn't make a fist or walk.
She is now back to almost 100% but continues to have some issues with her left
foot that we are hoping will resolve with time. What an ordeal. And thank you
for your patience while we focused on that. Today is her 17th birthday and I
can't tell you how grateful I am to have her home and doing so much better. I
have downloaded the app and look forward to learning more about the product. Do
I need a referral code or any other info for signing up or will the 14-day trial
automatically apply to the account? After 14 days of using the product, we will
circle back with our thoughts and our Media Kit for further discussion on
collaboration opportunities. Thanks again! Wendy A. Williamson Nina's Jewels,

Hi Mary and thanks for this info. We weren't aware that Posh Sidekick had a
crosslister. That is an exciting new feature. Unfortunately, it is not something
we are currently in the market for, and it sounds like it might not be a great
fit for our business model. We do currently crosslist using another software but
the biggest thing that would hold us back from trying it is that eBay is
currently our main source of reselling income, so we need a crosslisting tool
that interfaces with that application. We have been in the market for a Poshmark
sharing/VA type of product so if you guys are ever interested in partnering to
promote that part of your offerings, or if we've misunderstood and Posh Sidekick
does interface with eBay, let us know. Or, if that is something that you expand
to in the future, definitely reach out. Thanks! Wendy A. Williamson Nina's

two-week, no-strings-attached trial of Posh Sidekick. You can try it out, and
see how it fits with your brand, and there’s no charge at all during this

collaboration. All we need is your media kit to get started! As part of our
collaboration, we offer a 25% commission on the first purchase made by any of
your referrals. And if they subscribe, you’ll earn from that too! Plus, there’s
an easy way to earn: for every free trial sign-up using your unique code, you’ll
make $0.50. It’s as simple as that! Here’s how to start: 1. Download our app
from the App Store

Hi Mary and thanks for reaching out. I'm glad to hear you enjoy our channel. We
do consider paid collaboration opportunities for products we use and enjoy.
We've taken a look at your website, and we are definitely intrigued. This is
something we've dipped our toes in previously with another software with mixed
results. We currently don't have a software working for us to provide services
similar to Posh Sidekick. We would want an opportunity to try out Posh Sidekick
before agreeing to any affiliate deals or collabs. Is that possible? Once we
feel like it is a good match, what type of collaborations do you typically
offer? We do love spreading the good word about products that we love and that
make our job easier and more efficient. We look forward to hearing back! Wendy &

Hi. I have been a customer for over a year now and recently over the past two
months, any item of mine that has been relisted by your software the first image
in the listing becomes super gridlike with lines and fuzzy. It looks just awful
and now I have to retake my hero shots! Why is this happening? How can it be
fixed?I attached a screenshot of one of the listings to show you.

Hello Christie, Thank you for getting back to us,  I’ve taken a look at your
account and noticed that you currently have less than 10 items listed. To make
the most of our platform and reach more customers, it would be great if you
could add more items to your listing. In the meantime, I’ll bring this up with
our technical team to ensure everything is running smoothly on our end. Thanks
for your understanding and cooperation. Warm regards, Mary

I'm adding more items today and daily but it still won't let me set it to share.
How many items do I need? I really wanted to see it work in the trial before it
runs out because I am playing on subscribing if it works good for me. Thank you.

Hello Christie, Thank you for getting back to us and verifying your email. I’ve
taken a look at your account and it seems like the issue might be due to not
having any items listed in your closet at the moment. The sharing feature works
by sharing the items you have listed, so if there aren’t any items, there’s
nothing to share. To resolve this, I’d suggest adding more items to your
listing. Once you’ve done that, you should be able to adjust your shares and
settings without any issues. If you’re still having trouble after adding items,
please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help! Warm regards, Mary

Ok I unlinked then it stated "No such Subscription" .. Please cancel this The
reason I am canceling is that it is not increasing my sales as it did in the
beginning. I feel like I get shadow banded also. The 29.99 is not an investment
if it is not improving sales. I sell way more clothes on ebay.

Good evening, My name is Riham Ross and I have been subscribed for months now
and it really increased my sales so I am thankful. However, I have an issue with
my account that it was registered under rihamatawil@hotmail.com However, my
email address is rihamaltawil@hotmail.com so I haven’t been able to get any
email since I don’t have that email. And now that I am trying to subscribe to
Crosslisting, I am not able to login. Is there a way that I can switch the email
address to Rihamaltawil@hotmail.com? I don’t even know my password and I am
afraid something happens and o won’t be able to login as it would be sent to the
other email. Also, I need a help to access Crosslisting please. If you respond
to me at rihamaltawil@hotmail.com I will be grateful. Thanks, Riham

Leanne M. 21:51 Hi! After an initial OTL has expired on a specific listing and
no likers accepted or countered that offer is Sidekick capable of following up
sending new OTL with an increased discount (higher % off or further reduced
shipping) than the one sent initially? It’s not clear to me if Sidekick
continues to send offers until min profit has been reached. Can you clarify and
how best to navigate when listings are getting traction with OTL’s but they are
not being accepted or countered next best steps & how to set up in Sidekick?
Thanks so much! 21:52 Customer S. joined the chat at 21:52 Customer S. 21:52
Hello there Customer S. 21:52 thank you for reaching out! Customer S. 21:52
sorry to hear that please let me check Customer S. 22:00 Sidekick is designed to
send an Offer to Likers (OTL) after a specific listing is liked. Customer S.
22:00 After 24 hours, if an offer is not accepted, it will expire. Sidekick will
not automatically send another offer for the same listing after this period.

Hello, I actually like the Posh sidekick but it in my own opinion the $30 is
actually a bit expensive for a small time seller like me with less than 100
listing and 1 active store. I would love to subscribe if its not that expensive.
Hopefully in the future posh sidekick management would lower the price depending
on the listings of a store. Thabk you for reaching out to me.

Jayne K. 20:58 Hi 20:58 Customer S. joined the chat at 20:58 Customer S. 20:58
Hello there Customer S. 20:58 thank you for reaching out! Jayne K. 20:58 Having
issues with sidekick! I had to d Customer S. 20:58 sorry to hear that Jayne K.
20:59 Discoconnect since it saved my closet and I put it Customer S. 20:59
please let me check Jayne K. 21:00 On put closet in order. It said it was doing
that BT th Customer S. 21:00 Upon checking your closet is unlinked to the app
Jayne K. 21:00 Yes. I had to unlink Jayne K. 21:01 Now, I can't relink Customer
S. 21:01 please link it so I can check Customer S. 21:01 UNLINK - RELINK Go to
Profile Page > Click Switch Closet > Swipe left to Unlink > Then re-link your
new closet Jayne K. 21:01 I can't. It's not letting me link. It has an error and
it flages way to fast to read therror Customer S. 21:02 please try to refresh
your app first log out and then log back in Jayne K. 21:02 Ok... Jayne K. 21:02
Lot of work. Customer S. 21:03 sorry Jayne K. 21:10 I keep getting error
messages Jayne K. 21:10 Please can you let Engineering know about this...not the
1st time Jayne K. 21:10 I will try again tomorrow morning Customer S. 21:11 yes
please, thank you Jayne K. 21:12 I took a snapshot of my closet like I always
do..shared and the put back in order ..BUT share button stayed on even though it
said putting back in order Jayne K. 21:12 I'm in California and made the mistake
to TRY and share my closet again...ugh Customer S. 21:16 I understand your
concern. When the app is performing an activity, such as sharing or reordering
your closet, it’s best to let it complete the task before starting another one.
This is because multiple simultaneous actions can sometimes cause unexpected
behavior. Customer S. 21:16 If you notice that the share button stays on even
though it says “putting back in order”, it might be due to ongoing activity in
the app. In such cases, you might want to consider the following steps: Customer
S. 21:17 1. Wait for the current activity to finish: Before performing any other
actions, let the app complete its current task. Customer S. 21:17 2. Turn off
the sharing option: If you need to perform other activities on the app, it’s a
good idea to turn off the sharing option first Customer S. 21:17 I hope this
helps! If you continue to experience issues, please let us know. We’re here to
assist you. 21:43 Chat ended due to inactivity at 21:43

Hi, Thanks for reaching out. So I changed my closet name and it was not syncing
up with my sidekick app . I thought I needed to delete the user and create a new
one to be able to have it changed. I thought the main account was under my email
so I will be able to keep my data but everything got deleted. My bad i should
have reached out to support first. I just paid on my previous account for a
monthly subscription and wanted to know if it can be credited to my new account?
New closet Name is Kundra closet

closet is actively shared and the current activity is self-sharing. Could you
try to uninstall and reinstall the app again? Then before you log in, please

Hello Lisa, Thank you for reaching out! It seems like your app has been
soft-banned, which usually happens when there’s too much activity on your
account in a short period of time. This could be due to manually sharing offers
while the app also shares. To avoid this in the future, we recommend not
performing any activities on the app while it’s sharing. If you need to perform
any actions on the app, you can disable the sharing feature first. Please let us
know if you have any other questions or concerns. We’re here to help! Best

Hello Gina, Thank you for getting back to us, I understand that navigating
through the app settings can be a bit confusing. Let me help clarify. Currently,
your app is active and sharing your listings. The ‘Self-Party Share’ and ‘Feed
Sharing’ features are already enabled in your app’s settings. These features
help increase the visibility of your listings. Here’s a brief guide on how our
app works: https://poshsidekick.com/guide/ [https://poshsidekick.com/guide/] If
you want to explore more features, you can find them in the app’s settings. Each
feature has a description to help you understand its function. Warm regards,

Hello Serena, Thanks for reaching out and welcome to Sidekick! We’re excited to
have you on board. 😊 Regarding the new cross-listing tool, we’re in the final
stages of testing to ensure a smooth experience once it’s introduced. We
appreciate your patience and will keep you updated on its launch. As for your
sales, it’s quite normal for new users to take a little time to gain traction.
Don’t worry, your account and listings are all set up correctly, and our app is
driving traffic to your account. Let’s give it another week and see how things
progress. In the meantime, here are a few tips to boost your sales: * Silent
Auction & Background Remover: These features can make your listings more
appealing and attract more buyers. * Activity Check: You can monitor your
account activities on the app’s activity page. This will give you insights into
your listings’ performance. * Photos: Clear, well-lit photos that show different
angles of the item can significantly improve your listings. * Pricing: Check out
similar items on Poshmark and price yours competitively. Don’t hesitate to
negotiate with buyers using the “Offer” feature. Remember, we’re here to support
you. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask
Thanks again for your patience. We’re committed to ensuring you have a great
experience with Sidekick Kind regards, Mary

I've only made one sale. Is thus normal? I did much better with my other

sharing others items myself as well and my closet? Cause I am. Let me know

Deliska B. 16:33 Where is the area to cross-list our items to other platforms?
16:37 Customer S. joined the chat at 16:37 Customer S. 16:37 Hi thanks for
reaching out Customer S. 16:37 This is Kate Customer S. 16:38 Please be informed
that we are still working on the merging of the 2 apps. Customer S. 16:38 At the
moment it is a separate app Customer S. 16:39 Please download the app and sign
up using the same email associated with the Poshsidekick account. Customer S.
16:39 You can download the app on the link below: Crosslisting App: -Apple
Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crosslisting/id16...
[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crosslisting/id1622734136] -Play
Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=c...
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crosslistings] Deliska B.
16:41 Will it still be under the $14.99 price? Customer S. 16:42 The $14,99 is
for the Promoted listing, a separate subscription for more community shares
Customer S. 16:43 The monthly payment for Sidekick is 429.99 for 1 closet
Deliska B. 16:43 So how much is the cross-listing oing to cost? Customer S.
16:43 For being a Posh Sidekick subscriber, you'll receive the following free
features on the Crosslisting app: -Free 25 cross-listing credits per month -Free
20 Relisting on Mercari, eBay, Depop, Kidizen, and Grailed per day -50 more
cross-listing credits if you subscribe to any of our cross-listing packages
Deliska B. 16:43 $429.00 That's insane Customer S. 16:52 Oh sorry, it's $29.99
Customer S. 16:52 I'm so sorry for the confusion Deliska B. 16:52 Oh ok, I was
like what, lol. Customer S. 16:53 My sincere apologies for thr typo Deliska B.
16:53 So if you want to just use the sharing amd sending out offers feature,
them it's $14.99 Deliska B. 16:54 But if you add the other app and do
cross-listing too, then it goes from $14.99 to $24.99? Customer S. 16:54
Unfortunately. the $14.99 is an additional feature which is optional Deliska B.
16:55 So the $24.99 is just to share only on the one app, or does it provide the
sharing plus the cross-listing too? Customer S. 17:13 Here is a guide you can
check for the features you can have for the $29.99 subscription:
https://poshsidekick.com/guide/ [https://poshsidekick.com/guide/] Customer S.
17:14 As a subscriber, you will receive the free features mentioned above for
crosslisting Customer S. 17:14 If you have questions with the guide, please let
me know 17:26 Chat ended due to inactivity at 17:26

Hello. I am considering signing up to cross list but what do you mean by "number
of closets"? Does that mean if I want to list on Posh and Mercury that it would
be 2 closets? I just want to make sure I'm understanding right.

Hello Brenda, Thank you for getting back to us, I’m glad to hear that the “Offer
to Likers” feature is working for you now. 😊 As for your shares, it’s currently
at 4.1k, which falls under the medium sharing range of 5-7k they should pick up
before midnight. You might want to consider disabling the “Randomized OTL and
Relist” feature. This feature adds a randomized delay of 1-15 minutes to the
normal OTL and relisting time, Please continue to monitor your shares and let us
know if you have any other concerns. We’re here to help! Best regards, Mary

Hello Sally, Thank you for reaching out. Upon further checking, it appears that
your account was soft-banned. However, please don't worry, as the restriction
for your closet will be lifted after some time. To prevent this from happening
again, I suggest turning off the sharing features of the app before sharing or
adding new items to your closet. Once you've finished sharing/adding items, you
can then turn the sharing feature back on. Thank you. Best, Kate

of nonpayment. I talked to someone the other day that said my account was OK. I
recently got a new debit card and it wasn’t attached to sidekick yet. I added it
and the person that I talked to the other day said it was good to go but now I’m
getting emails saying that my subscription will be canceled. I’m confused on
which one it is.

Ana, I changed the setting to 60 days, which is sooner than I want to relist,
but it's still showing the same thing on upcoming relistings--there definitely
seems to be something amiss with the relisting widget.

Hi Krista, Thank you for your email! Upon hearing from our Technical Team,
please be advised to change the relisting age of your items form 90 days to 60
0r 30 days, to refresh the items under your Upcoming relist. If it does not
update on the following days, please inform us, so we can further check it.

Hi, This issue is still not fixed. My "relisting today" screen shows the same
four items as yesterday, although two of them (the Selkie dress and the Son De
Flor jacket) have been relisted. The other two are still waiting for relists.
There is clearly something happening with the relist function--this did not used
to be the case. Please advise when I can expect this to be resolved.

I cannot unsubscribe, it gives me an error that there is no such subscription
but it tells me that I’m going to be charged tomorrow the 8th. I have unlinked
my closet like it told me to and that’s when I got the error and somehow my

Hi, I can’t add in my closet at the moment. Looking to sync my US poshmark
closet. I also switched recently from posherva to posh sidekick and was curious
if I could apply for the 30 day free offer. Thank you!

Hi Sandy, Thank you for reaching out. Please be informed that I have refreshed
your closet. I can confirm that your closet is sharing, and its current activity
is party share. Kindly be advised to logout and login once more to refresh the
app. If you encounter this issue again, please don’t hesitate to inform us. This
step will help prevent the problem from happening again. Thank you so much for
your cooperation and understanding! Best regards, Kate

﻿Hi, I noticed 15’ ago that nothing in my closet had been shared for 4 hours &
before that it shows 7 hours then 10 hours then 16 hours. I have my closet set
on fastest sharing speed so it’s usually seconds or minutes between shares, NOT
HOURS. What’s going on? I’m sure you guys are really busy, but that infrequency
of sharing is so unfair to me. If I were doing myself I’d do at least every
hour, yet I pay for your service to do it for me. Please let me know why this is
happening. Thank you, Sandy Moran

Hi Lori, Thanks for reaching out. I have added back the auction credit to your
account. Upon further checking, I can confirm that your closet is now linked and
is actively sharing. The current activity of your closet is self share. Please
be advised to logout and login once more to refresh the app. Thank you. Best,
Kate

Hello Yvonne, Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Thanks for your

they’re set as desired. If the issue persists after these steps, we’ll need to
investigate further. In that case, could you please provide us with more
detailed information about the issue? This will assist our technical team in
their investigation. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. We’re

The top pic shows where the Ring had a "view offer" after a like. The second and
third photo were TURNED OFF when I went to PSK to check AND I SAW the setting
turned off. . I turned on at that point. AGAIN. One other item, I turned on the
option to tell me when an item has sold. Your 'cha-Ching' sound. I guess it's
off too. 🫤 Thank you for your response. Yvonne.

I was wondering 🤔 what happened to the comment section on automated shows? I
like to pop in [if available] throughout my show to read what people are saying
or answer any questions. At the least, I usually touch base with them if they do
have questions. However, in the last couple weeks or so I’ve noticed that if I
have let’s say 70 viewers overall, I can only see the first 20 +/- viewers and
then I cannot keep scrolling to see any interaction. Is there something
different going on? 🤓❤️

Hello Veronica, I’m sorry to hear about the confusion. From what I can see, the
app is actively sharing your listings. Sometimes, it might take a moment for
updates to reflect on your end. 1.png

Here’s what you can do: 1. Log out and log back in: This can often refresh the
app and resolve minor glitches. 2. Check your shares: After logging back in,
please check if your shares are updating. If the issue persists after these

Hello Veronica, Thank you for getting back to us, I understand your concern.
Sharing sold items can indeed be confusing for potential buyers. If these items
are still being shared, it might be because they’re not properly tagged as
“sold” on Poshmark. image.png
[https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/106277/81144f038b2e3a7cada534b8c2b0d5916eae62d2/a99cddd0faa079a0ac475c0392913bd20d797471/image.png]
Here’s what you can do: 1. Log in to Poshmark and go to “My Closet”. 2. Click on
the listing you want to update. 3. Click “Edit Listing”. 4. Scroll to the very
bottom to “Availability”. 5. Click the dropdown and select “Not for Sale”. 6.
Click “Update”. This should prevent your sold items from being shared. If you
continue to experience issues, please let us know. We’re here to help! Kind
regards, Mary

Hi Karen, Thanks for responding. Please be advised to turn off the sharing
features of the app if you wish to manually follow and share so that you won't
be soft banned. Once you've finished, you can then turn the sharing features
back on. A soft ban means that your closet is temporarily blocked from sharing
or following by Poshmark due to excessive activity. This can occur if you
manually share or add new items while the app is already sharing your listings
or if you exceed the daily limits set by Poshmark. It's important to note that
this is not a serious issue, and it does not put your account in any danger. The
soft ban is simply an automated action taken by Poshmark, and it can sometimes
trigger without warning for minor reasons. Rest assured that our app "Posh
Sidekick" has built-in safety measures to handle situations like this, and
typically, the issue is resolved within 2 to 3 hours. Thank you. Best, Kate

Oh that's great! I guess I read it at a time when it was in a pause mode. When
it's running, am I allowed to follow and share other closets?

Hi KAren, Thanks for reaching out. Upon further checking, I can confirm that
your free trial is good until March 11, 2024, and your closet is sharing. The
current activity is self share. Thank you. Best, Kate

Hi Dayna, Thank you for your response, We’ve always been proud of our
cross-listing app, but we’re taking it to the next level. We’re merging it with
our Posh Sidekick to create a single, powerful platform that we believe will be
unbeatable in the market. This merger will combine the best features of both
apps, providing a seamless and superior user experience. We’re confident that
this will revolutionize the way our users interact with our platform and each
other. Here's what's in it for you: We’d like to offer you a two-week,
no-strings-attached trial of Posh Sidekick. You can try it out, and see how it
fits with your brand, and there’s no charge at all during this period. If you
find it’s a good match, we’d be happy to discuss a paid collaboration. All we
need is your media kit to get started! As part of our collaboration, we offer a
25% commission on the first purchase made by any of your referrals. And if they
subscribe, you’ll earn from that too! Plus, there’s an easy way to earn: for
every free trial sign-up using your unique code, you’ll make $0.50. It’s as
simple as that! Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Kind regards, Mary

Hello Julia, Thanks for getting back to us and I'm sorry for any inconvenience
caused by the charge. I take the necessary steps to correct it and your renewal

Hi there, Julia! Just following up on a few quick things - I know you had
mentioned that you were going to see if the team could make the personalized
referral code - do you know if that was done? I want to make sure I've got the
most current code listed in my video descriptions (looks like I've already had a
few signups which is great!) Second, if at all possible, would you also be able
to take a look at my account? I was settling my finances this past monday and I
noticed I got charged again on the 4th of this month - usually I get hit for
payment on the 18th, so I got charged on March 18th as expected, and then I just
got charged again on the 4th. I know you had mentioned that you'd credit me with
2 complimentary weeks, so maybe wires somehow got crossed and the payment was
charged 2 weeks early instead of late? Either way - any help is much
appreciated! I'll keep spreading the good word - Sidekick's really been a
lifesaver, and so many of my subscribers are loving it as well! In the meantime,
I hope you have a fabulous weekend! All the best, Julia

Hi there, Julia Oh! SO sorry! I signed up for this before I created these

that at some point...) - if, for some reason you're still unable to locate it
with that email, my closet name is @jm2vintage (and if you ARE unable to find it
via that email address, let me know so I can make sure i don't have any kind of
typos in my account...) It would be amazing if we were able to do a code like
"JMSquared" or something like that, so it's a bit easier to remember for my
viewers. Thanks again, so much, for your help! All the best, Julia

Hello there, Thank you for your response! We've attempted to search using both
of your email addresses, but unfortunately, we couldn't locate any information.
To proceed with adding the 2-week free trial to your account, could you please
share your closet name with us? Once we have your closet name, we'll ensure the
trial is added without delay. Regarding your referral code, you can continue to
use your existing code. However, if you prefer a more personalized option using
your closet name, you can use that as well. Just let us know your preference so
we can ask the team to make some changes. If you have any further questions,

Hi Julia! Thanks so much for reaching out! I've actually been using Sidekick for
months, and I absolutely love it! As a former startup founder myself (and a
marketing consultant for countless startups), I've been crazy impressed by
Michael and Erica (I know there's another founder in the mix there that isn't
public facing - so by extension impressed by them as well) - I know exactly how
much it takes to get something like this off the ground, and they're really
just....doing it right. I hope that, at some point, they get a real vacation,
because I'm sure they all need it! Anyway let me know what next steps would be -
no need for me to try anything out - I'm already a HUGE fan :) All the best,
Julia P.S. You've got a great name :)

collaboration as initially planned. Despite the quality of your content, the
campaign did not achieve the level of exposure and referral generation we
anticipated for Posh Sidekick. However, we would be pleased to continue our
partnership through our affiliate program, which offers the same commission rate
without the complimentary service. For further details, please refer to the
terms outlined in the contract. We appreciate your understanding and look

Hello Aileen, Your unique referral code is hustleandslow. When you share this
code with your viewers, they can use it during their sign-up process. This will
allow us to track that they came from your videos. For each viewer who uses your
referral code and makes their first purchase, you will receive a 20% commission.
This commission is for a lifetime or until they cancel their subscription,
meaning you’ll continue to earn from their purchases as long as they remain
subscribed. Additionally, for each viewer who signs up for a free trial using
your code, you will receive $0.50. Please ensure your viewers enter the
code hustleandslow in the appropriate field during sign-up. This is crucial for
the tracking process. If you have any more questions or need further
clarification, feel free to ask. Best, Mary

has helped boost sales. I've attached a clip for your reference.

Hello Aileen, We’re equally excited about this collaboration! We don’t have any
particular requests for the videos, However, we’d love for you to include
features like Closet Snapshot, Silent Auction, Promoted Listings, and more. We

the total fee for the services is $900.00. Posh Sidekick will provide an upfront
payment of 50% of the total fee, which amounts to $450.00. The remaining 50%
will be paid after the successful upload of the videos on YouTube. Please note
that there is no free monthly service. The payment will be made through your
PayPal account. This is a monthly agreement. We look forward to seeing your

as specific features to mention, where you want it in the videos, etc. Or do I
have creative control to do everything as I see fit? - As far as payment goes,
do I just get paid once both videos are posted and links sent to you each month?
And is this an ongoing collaboration? I just want to be 100% clear on the
expectations so that I can make sure everything goes smoothly. Thanks again!

Hi Serena, Thank you for reaching out. Everything looks good with your account
and your listings are all set. Our app is driving traffic to your account, which
is great. Let’s give it another week and see if sales improve. To boost your
sales, try using the silent auction and background remover features. They can
make your listings more appealing and attract more buyers. Also, you can check
the activities of your account on the activities page and inside page of the
app. This will give you a better understanding of what’s happening with your
listings. Here are a couple of tips to help you sell more: Photos: Make sure
your photos are clear, well-lit, and show different angles of the item. Pricing:
Check out similar items on Poshmark and price yours competitively. Feel free to
negotiate with buyers using the “Offer” feature. If you have any more questions
or need help, just let us know. Thank you for your patience. We’re here to make
sure you have a great experience with Sidekick. Best, Gail

integrated Video. There are no discounted rates available at this time. The
video agreed upon will be done within 2 weeks of receiving the product. I don't
offer gift exchange collaborations so if you don't have outside budget we can
figure out a price that would work best for both of us. Thank you,

Hello Jessica, Thank you for reaching out. Upon checking, your account
experienced a soft ban and I can confirm that it was already been lifted. Your
closet now is actively shared and currently in self-sharing activity. To prevent
the soft ban from happening again, I suggest turning off the sharing features of
the app before sharing or adding new items to your closet. Once you've finished
sharing/adding items, you can then turn the sharing feature back on. I hope this
clarifies things for you! If you have any more questions or need further
assistance, feel free to ask. Best regards, Gail

I did check on Poshmark and the last shared item matched the same time as
sidekick. No sharing was occurring! That's what alerted me to the problem. I saw
that items were over 30min since the last share. I then checked t sidekick and
confirmed there was a problem. I thought the last patch was going to fix this
problem. I'm going to have to find another solution that's reliable because this
can't keep happening!

Hello Hazel, Thank you for getting back to us, Thank you for getting back to us
and providing more details. I understand your concern. Upon checking, the app is
currently sharing. However, if it’s not showing updates on your end, it might be
due to a temporary bug. In this case, I recommend refreshing your app by logging
out and then logging back in from the app’s profile page. If you have the same
issue in the future, please also check the last updated time on the Poshmark
app. Let me know if the issue persists. We’re here to help. Kind regards, Mary

Thanks for your response but I check activities and nothing was sharing. It was
stalled and the last thing being shared was 35 minutes when I first noticed and
did not change at all for over 50 minutes. The same item remained at the top of
the activities screen for over 50 minutes. If it was alternating between party
shares and self shares, that first listing should have been bumped down as other
items shared. Am I wrong?

Body:
Hello Hazel, My apologies for the confusion. Let me clarify how the party share
feature works. Upon checking, it appears that the app is alternating between
party-sharing and self-sharing. During the first three party shares, the app
performs both self-shares and party shares. However, only the eligible listings
are shared to the party. For instance, if a listing is not eligible for a themed
party, it will be shared to your followers instead. Here’s an example of how
this works: * Share Listing 1 - This item is eligible for the party, so it’s
shared to the party. * Share Listing 2 - This item is not eligible for the
party, so it’s shared to your followers. * Share Listing 3 - This item is not
eligible for the party, so it’s shared to your followers. * Share Listing 4 -
This item is eligible for the party, so it’s shared to the party. * Share
Listing 5 - This item is eligible for the party, so it’s shared to the party.
However, during the 10 pm to 12 am party, all items are considered eligible and
are shared to the party, regardless of their theme. The app does not pre-select
the listings that will be shared to the party. Instead, it continues the cycle
of sharing and when the party time occurs, it shares the listings that are
eligible for that particular party. This means that the specific listings shared
to the party are determined by the timing of the party and the cycle of sharing,
rather than being pre-selected by the app. I hope this clarifies the process for
you. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, please don’t
hesitate to ask. Thank you so much! Kind regards, Mary

Hello Lydia, Thank you for reaching out! Thank you for your questions. Here are
the answers: 1. Promoted Listing: Yes, you need to be a paid subscriber of Posh
Sidekick to use the promoted listing feature. It’s an add-on to your regular
subscription. 2. Posh Shows: The $29.99 plan includes silent auctions, which
come with 7 auction credits weekly. If you need more credits, subscribing to
promoted listings will give you an additional 14 credits weekly. 3.
Cross-Listing: The merger is yet to be launched. However, as a Sidekick
subscriber, you’ll receive the following free features for cross-listing: * Free
25 cross-listing credits per month * Free 20 relisting on Mercari and Depop per
day * An additional 50 cross-listing credits if you subscribe to any of our
cross-listing packages To sign up for Crosslisting, please use the same email
address that you used for your Posh Sidekick account. This will ensure that your
accounts are linked and that you can seamlessly use the features across both
platforms. Crosslisting App: -Apple Store:

1) Do you have to use posh side kick to use the promoted listing of posh
sidekick? 2) do you have to pay extra for posh shows or are they included in the
price of $ 29.99 3) are you now cross-listing and is that included in the price
of $29.99

change its order. The app doesn't have an option for that for now. Let me know

Hello Kim, I apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. It appears that
you unsubscribed, as we have received an email about it possibly due to a glitch
during the account downgrade process. However, I’ve taken care of it by creating
a new subscription for you and adding the paid month. Please go ahead and check
your account now. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask. Thank
you! Best, Julia

Hi there I had two accounts on this US Poshmark and Canadian Poshmark. I’m
putting my US closet on hold so I wanted to remove it from this service. I did
unlink it already, but can’t figure out how to take off two closet subscription
as I only want a one closet subscription for my Canadian one as well. I used a
discount code for my Canadian fee but does that code go onto every monthly
charge or do I have to enter it every time thank you

Hello, I've had a subscription to your service for months, but I recently
decided to cancel it due to my lack of active listings. I couldn't justify the
price for the amount of sales I did per month. I cancelled my service before my
subscription renewal date on 3/4. I somehow accidentally completely deleted my
whole account and am not longer able to log in. Even though I cancelled my
service, my credit card was still charged. I need to make sure my credit card is
taken out of your records. I do not want to continue to be charged. My poshmark
username is: maggiebrandy And the email associated with the account was:
maggiecrowley21@gmail.com [maggiecrowley21@gmail.com] Thank you for your time,

Hi Joelle, Thank you for your email! We appreciate your feedback. I am sorry for
the confusion and let me clarify some things regarding your concerns. I would
like to inform you that the merge of the 2 apps (Posh Sidekick & Crosslisting)
is currently in progress. You may refer to the below link about the announcement
for more details in the merging of both apps: Announcement Replay
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=PeMzpN2rhWQ] Regarding you
Crosslisting concern, you will receive 25 free credits every month for being a
Posh Sidekick subscriber. Please note that you need to use the same email
address from your Posh Sidekick account when you create your account in
Crosslisting right now. Aside from the 25 free credits, you will also get the
below freebies: * Free 20 Relisting on Mercari and Depop * 50 more crosslisting
credits (only if you subscribe to any of our crosslisting packages
[https://crosslisting.com/pricing/]) Please feel free to contact us if you have
any concerns or need further assistance, and we will be more than happy to
assist you. Thank you! Kind regards, Ana

Hi there, Her current you tube video that is out doesn't talk about a merge at
all. It talks about the Crosslisting app and how to download it and create
listings etc. Nothing about a merge of apps. It's also confusing as to how a
current Sidekick user is able to get/use their 25 cross listings per month.
Honestly, none of it is very clear. You may want to check out the comments on
her you tube yourself. A lot of confusion, from what i saw. Any help would be
much appreciated. Joelle > On Mar 5, 2024, at 20:02, Posh Sidekick wrote: > ﻿

weekend. I did not need to continue the service as I don't have that many active

Closet Name funstuff2 Issue Hi I may have done this backward--I'm a new
customer. I was referred by a friend with the referral code 679245. I first
signed up on my phone but I think I had the wrong Poshmark password so I fixed
that. I was hoping to use this on my desktop computer but when I click on Google
Play, there is no option to download it. So I'm wondering if I just have to go
to your website to use it? Or can I install it as an extension on Chrome? Thank
you so much. I'm looking forward to getting started, I've heard so many good
things! Rhonda Porzadek funstuff2 on Posh

Hi Amber, Thank you for your email! My apologies for the inconvenience that this
has caused you. Please be informed that I have now processed a refund for the
duplicate subscription and payment of $29.99. I just wanted to inform you that
the cause of the other charge is due to a duplicate subscription. I have
canceled the duplicate subscription to avoid other charges. The funds may take
5-10 business days to settle in your account. Thank you so much! Best regards,
Gail

Hello Jackie, Thank you for getting back to us, I apologize for any confusion.
The first email suggesting a reinstall might have been sent in the context of an
app update. It’s always a good practice to keep your app updated to the latest
version to ensure optimal performance and access to new features. As for the
banner indicating that the merger feature was ready, I regret any
misunderstanding. The merger feature is indeed in the pipeline, but it has not
been released yet. We’re working to bring this feature to you as soon as
possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience. If you have any other
questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Warm regards, Mary

So I decided to use the code and give Sidekick another try and now I have
numerous duplicate listings in my closet that were not there before. I deleted
some but there are numerous. This needs to be corrected ASAP. Not only do I not
have time to go through and delete listings that Sidekick duplicated, it will
not address whatever issue is causing it. Please investigate and resolve
immediately. April Custer @theaprilly

Hi Joanne, Thank you for getting back to us and confirming your email address.
To add another closet from your app on your phone, you might first need to
upgrade to a 2-closet count. Once you’ve done that, you can follow these steps:
1. Go to the Profile page. 2. View billing 3. slide the slider to 2 closets
count https://payment.poshsidekick.com [https://payment.poshsidekick.com] I hope
this helps! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please

Rose H. 18:06 Yes, I checked that and saw items that were not mine in that app
Rose H. 18:07 Something looks kinda wrong to me Rose H. 18:08 Not impressed at
all over the last very minths Customer S. 18:09 Yes, that was community sharing
the one you're asking earlier. The app performs community sharing since you
enabled it. Customer S. 18:09 I have check the previous months refund, and I can
confirm it has been processed. Customer S. 18:10 image.png 21.9 KB

that only works half the time Customer S. 18:18 Rest assured that we will review
the refund and email you an update about it. Rose H. 18:18 Probably a good idea
Customer S. 18:21 Regarding our app, I understand it's a little bit confusing
when you take a look at the activities and rely on checking the gaps in shares.
Rose H. 18:22 A bit confusing Rose H. 18:22 I think I would know if my closet
has beven shared or not Customer S. 18:22 Please be informed that the app
consists of 3 types of shares. Self-share - Shared to followers Community shares
- Shared to followers from the feed Party Shares - Shared to Party Customer S.
18:23 Yes, you can simply verify it directly in your closet if you think app is
not working. Customer S. 18:23 But upon checking, the app is sharing your
listings. Rose H. 18:24 Yes now it is wasn't all day Customer S. 18:24 If you
notice no activities in your app, please share with us a screenshot of your
activities Customer S. 18:25 And will surely check it for you. Rose H. 18:25 Yup

Hello Rose, Thank you for getting back to me. In the case of a reversal, you
will not see a refund credit on your statement you'll just see the original
authorization drop off your statement entirely after a few days. There will be
no payment and no refund. It'll appear as if the whole transaction never
happened. Your bank should be able to confirm this for you. Depending on your
card issuer, the original charge should have disappeared from their pending
charges. I hope this clarifies your concern. If you have any other questions or
need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Gail

you: 1. Earn Big: Get a 15% commission on every referral for life! 2. Easy
Earnings: Make $0.50 for every free trial sign-up using your code. We're
offering you a two-week risk-free trial of Posh Sidekick, no obligations or
charges. And if you're interested, we're open to discussing a paid
collaboration. Just share your media kit with us! If this sounds good to you,

Hi Mikayla, Thanks for your interest! We would actually like to inquire about
your pricing. Could you please provide your rates or any specific requirements
you have for paid collaborations? Also, would it be possible for you to share

Hi Mikayla, Thanks for sharing your media kit! It's great to see the
comprehensive overview of your reach and engagement. As we move forward with
discussing potential collaboration opportunities, I'd like to inquire about your
pricing. Could you please provide your rates or any specific requirements you
have for paid collaborations? Additionally, to ensure that our collaboration
aligns with your audience's interests and preferences, would it be possible for
you to share analytics related to Poshmark for the past month? This would help
us better understand the potential impact of our partnership. Looking forward to
your response and the possibility of working together! Best regards, Kate

Hey Mikayla, Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to reach out and say we're big
fans of your YouTube content ! We've got something exciting happening at Posh
Sidekick, and I think you'd be interested. We've got this awesome feature on
Poshmark called Automated Live Auction. It's been around for a while, but we
think you'd be perfect to share it with your audience. Here's what's in it for
you: 1. Earn Big: Get a 15% commission on every referral for life! 2. Easy
Earnings: Make $0.50 for every free trial sign-up using your code. We're
offering you a two-week risk-free trial of Posh Sidekick, no obligations or
charges. And if you're interested, we're open to discussing a paid
collaboration. Just share your media kit with us! If this sounds good to you,
just hit reply and let me know! We'd love to work with you! Cheers, Kate Posh

Hello Lori, Thanks for asking! The team updated the app today and the changes
might cause some issues with sharing that did not reflect right away. Regarding
changing the discounts, it will not affect sharing. And putting it at medium
speed is good but if you notice it's still a little slow you can give it a try
and change it to fast speed. The merging of one app will be soon released and
will explain and share a guide about it. But one thing is very exciting, you
will be using one app and your subscription will be one in bill. Let me know if
you have any questions! Thank you! Best, Olivia

Hi That was weird they didn't share for 1-2 hours. I just checked now l, they
both are sharing. I changed my discount to likers from 20 to 30% yesterday and
noticed I had a spike in my self sharing. Do you think that's why it slowed this
morning? I turned both closets to medium sharing is that better than fast? I'm
crosslisting a lot of items from my Canadian to US with your app. I also wanted
to ask about how it works for those of us who have both sidekick and
crosslisting. I know you are merging the apps Thank you for your quick response!

Jackie 12:56 Hi 12:57 Customer S. joined the chat at 12:57 Customer S. 12:57 Hi
thanks for reaching out Customer S. 12:57 This is Kate Customer S. 12:57 How can
I help you today? Jackie 12:59 It keeps telling me that my sidekick has stopped
working, and then I need to contact support Customer S. 13:00 Please let me
check Jackie 13:00 Ok Customer S. 13:04 Upon further checking, it appears that
your account was soft-banned. However, please don't worry, as the restriction
for your closet will be lifted after some time. Customer S. 13:05 To prevent
this from happening again, I suggest turning off the sharing features of the app
before sharing or adding new items to your closet. Customer S. 13:05 Once you've
finished sharing/adding items, you can then turn the sharing feature back on.
Jackie 13:05 What does a soft ban mean Customer S. 13:06 A soft ban means that
your closet is temporarily blocked from sharing or following by Poshmark due to
excessive activity. This can occur if you manually share or add new items while
the app is already sharing your listings or if you exceed the daily limits set
by Poshmark. It's important to note that this is not a serious issue, and it
does not put your account in any danger. Customer S. 13:06 The soft ban is
simply an automated action taken by Poshmark, and it can sometimes trigger
without warning for minor reasons. Rest assured that our app "Posh Sidekick" has
built-in safety measures to handle situations like this, and typically, the
issue is resolved within 2 to 3 hours. Jackie 13:06 Ok Jackie 13:07 Thank you
Customer S. 13:11 You're most welcome! 13:38 Chat ended due to inactivity at

Hello Susan, Thanks for reaching out! I apologize to hear about your concern.
I've refreshed your account and Posh Sidekick is now sharing your listings. We
have released a new version of the app, and it may be the reason why sharing
didn't reflect on your end. Please reinstall the latest version of the app from
the App Store or Google Play. Delete or uninstall the app and download it from
the App Store or Play Store. If you have any further concerns or if there's
anything else we can assist you with, please let us know. Thank you! Best
regards, Julia

Sidekick seems to be frozen. No sharing for 5 hours. I've refreshed and rebooted
my phone to no avail. Any suggestions? Thank you!

Kate Customer S. 12:25 Please let me check your account Customer S. 12:28 I have
refreshed your closet and should be sharing now Customer S. 12:29 To prevent
this from happening again, I suggest turning off the sharing features of the app
before sharing or adding new items to your closet. Once you've finished
sharing/adding items, you can then turn the sharing feature back on. 12:55 Chat

Amanda C. 12:15 It is not allowing me to save an individual prices in auction
Amanda C. 12:15 And I did it through posh mark and it reset when k wasn’t on
Amanda C. 12:15 To the the price I had listed 12:16 Customer S. joined the chat
at 12:16 Customer S. 12:18 Hello Amanda, I am Simon. Customer S. 12:18 Thank you
so much for reaching out! Customer S. 12:19 Please let me give you a detailed
information of this feature and how to set up correctly. Customer S. 12:21
Individual pricing is a sub-option for the Starting Price (Percentage off or
Value Type) that you have set up. Once you've configured a Starting Price for
your items, you'll have the ability to edit the prices of listings that you
don't want to run with the Starting Price discount or value. For example:
Starting Price (Percentage off): 20% Individual Pricing: Original Price: $20
Starting Price: -16+ You'll be able to edit the listing's starting price of $16
(discounted by 20%). Please note that you need to set up a “Starting Price”
first. After that, you can go to the “Individual Pricing” page to change the
price of specific items. This allows you to have different prices for different

Amber, I am Simon. Customer S. 11:37 Thank you so much for reaching out! Amber
A. 11:37 Hello Customer S. 11:37 Please let me check it. Amber A. 11:38 Ok
Customer S. 11:43 Upon checking, you are currently on a soft ban. Please keep in
mind that it lasts for about 2-3 hours. To avoid a soft ban, do not share your
closet or add listings while the app is sharing. This is because Poshmark
sometimes considers this to be a high level of activity in your closet. Please
avoid using two sharing services at the same time. Customer S. 11:43 Rest
assured that the app will automatically resume sharing once the restriction is
lifted. Also, if you want to work on your closet, please disable all sharing
features to avoid this. Amber A. 11:44 Okay thank you Customer S. 11:44 You're
most welcome, Amber! Customer S. 11:44 Thank you for your understanding. 11:49

Hey Support - did you know 50% of SaaS operators do not localize their pricing?
...But here's the thing - willingness to pay varies by region. This means
there's a massive opportunity to maximize revenue that's currently being
overlooked. Willingness to pay by region

Just tried both, as I did earlier, and it's not working with new or copies. It
also scheduled a show that I had nothing to do with! First pic is the show, new,
that I tried after trying to copy one. Second pic is a show that I had last
night and haven't touched since! It says it's been scheduled but when I click on
it, on Poshmark, it says it's over with. The show for an hour ago doesn't exist
on the Sidekick app.

I've tried scheduling 4 shows and they all keep telling me that I already have a
show at that time. As you can see from the screenshots, I don't have anything
scheduled. I updated my app after the first time it failed so that can't be it.

Hello Ashley, Thank you so much for reaching out! Please let me explain this
feature. This will represent the lowest possible discount you would want to give
on any item. If someone sends you an offer for more than what this value is, it
will automatically trigger. This represents how much of a counteroffer you will
send back, once the reserve price has been triggered. The counter-offer feature
becomes active when you receive a lowball offer that falls below the specified
minimum percentage threshold for countering. EXAMPLE: Let's say you've listed an
item for $60, and in your settings, you've established a minimum percentage
threshold to trigger a counteroffer at 50%, with a counteroffer percentage of
10%. When someone offers you $30 for that item, which is exactly 50% of the
original price, the counter-offer mechanism kicks in. It generates a
counter-offer of $54, representing a 10% discount off the initial price. The
counter-offer feature will not trigger if someone sends an offer that is above
the minimum percentage threshold you have set. In other words, it only comes
into play when an offer is at or below the specified threshold. For instance, in
this scenario, the counter-offer mechanism activates when an offer falls below
$30, which is less than 50% of the item's original price. Any offer exceeding
this 50% threshold will not trigger the counter-offer functionality. I hope you
find it helpful. If you still have any questions or concern, please let me know.
Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Hey there, I'm a subscriber and I went into the settings area and wanted to get
more information on the reverse price feature. I wasn't quite understanding what
each field (min percent to counter & min percent) was meaning exactly. If I
could get more in-depth detail explanation on how to set this up, I would
greatly appreciate it. --- Date: March 5, 2024 Time: 4:53 pm Page URL:

my subscription as of 2/4/2024, and received an email stating this was a
voluntary cancellation on that date. You have continued to bill me this month. I
need this corrected. I have attached a screen shot of the email I received.
Please advise as to what I need to do next, I do not wish to use Posh Sidekick
services any longer and I have not used the service since 2/4/2024. Thank you

My upcoming relists are not saving the price when they are then relisted. I drop
prices before relisting for closet clearout. Then I make sure I save the price I
want to relist item which is higher than dropped price. Many times it is not
saving and relisting at lower price. This has on a couple items that I couldn't
fix right away people liking the item at lower prices and getting sent an even
lower offer. I have had to change the size of the item to get that very low
offer canceled. It just adds a lot of work and my items risk getting sold at a
price I am not comfortable with. I don't really want to turn off relist feature
because I am paying quite a bit of money for it and it is an important part of
why I am paying for the app.

We recently noticed a suspicious payment on your Stripe account for
poshsidekick.com. For the majority of your payments, our machine learning system
provides real-time transaction scoring at the time of a payment, but in some
instances, as is the case here, we learn more about a payment's risk level after
it's been processed. If you believe this payment was made with a stolen credit
card, you should issue a refund to avoid a dispute and the dispute fee.

Hello Erykah, Thank you so much for reaching out! I sincerely apologize for
facing this issue. I have now fixed it, and your closet is now being shared.
Please check it now. Please log out of the Sidekick app and then re-login. If
you still encounter the same issue, please let me know. Have a great day! Best
Regards, Simon

I’m not sure what’s going on with my account, last month I was double charged
and you guys refunded the extra charge. And now I just saw the charge go through
on my account but here it’s saying my trial ended and I haven’t had service for
several days apparently.

Hello Amanda, Thank you for reaching out! Individual pricing is a sub-option for
the Starting Price (Percentage off or Value Type) that you have set up. Once
you've configured a Starting Price for your items, you'll have the ability to
edit the prices of listings that you don't want to run with the Starting Price
discount or value. For example: Starting Price (Percentage off): 20% Individual
Pricing: Original Price: $20 Starting Price: -16+ You'll be able to edit the
listing's starting price of $16 (discounted by 20%). Please note that you need
to set up a “Starting Price” first. After that, you can go to the “Individual
Pricing” page to change the price of specific items. This allows you to have
different prices for different items if needed. If you still have any questions
or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you! Kind
regards, Simon

Hello again. I'm reaching out because I deleted my account without unlinking my
poshmark account or ending my subscription. I created another sidekick account
with the same email and reconnected onto my poshmark account but it doesn't show
up as having an ongoing subscription anymore. I just want to reach out and make
sure that I will not be getting charged for the subscription.

Mark B. 22:59 Will the $31 be refunded as well? Customer S. 23:00 It wasn't. It
for your subscription for that period Mark B. 23:01 What period. The 7 day trial
period cost me $31 that I wasn’t even able to use Mark B. 23:02 What kind of
scam is that? Customer S. 23:02 The 7 day free trial is for Posh Sidekick sir
Mark B. 23:03 I can’t wait to let Tab’s know what mess she got me into Mark B.
23:03 Cancel everything. Go ahead and keep the $31. Customer S. 23:04 I’m really
sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. If there’s anything else I can do to
assist or improve your experience, please let me know. Mark B. 23:04 You scammed
me for $31. Tabs said it was a free trial. Customer S. 23:09 I’m sorry for any
misunderstanding. Upon checking, it appears that in addition to signing up for
cross-listing, you also subscribed to our service, which resulted in the charge.
However, I want to assure you that we’re here to help. Customer S. 23:09 I’ve
already processed a refund of $31 to your account. Please allow 5-10 business
days for the transaction to reflect in your account. Mark B. 23:10 Please cancel
any further subscriptions. Thank you. Customer S. 23:10 Again, I apologize for
any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any more questions or need
further assistance, feel free to ask. Customer S. 23:11 It's already canceled
sir, rest assured there will be no future billings. 23:11 Customer left the chat

Hello April, Thank you for getting back to us, I understand that you’re planning
to put your closet on hold for a vacation. While we can’t process a credit for
the unused days, we can certainly pause your subscription during your vacation
period. To pause your Sidekick app, you can follow these steps: 1. Log in to the
Sidekick app. 2. Go to the settings. 3. Untick all the sharing features. This
will effectively put your Sidekick app on hold. When you’re ready to resume, you
can simply go back to the settings and tick the sharing features again.
Additionally, we’d like to offer you a coupon code that you can apply upon
renewal of your subscription. Once you’re ready to resume the service, please
let us know and we’ll provide you with the code. If you have any more questions
or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Best regards, Mary

No problem. I did not access any of the features such as picking 7 items to
promote or the auction credits. I can't provide proof because I did not use
them. Is there a way for you to view that information: that nothing within it

Hello Taylor, Thank you so much for asking! I am sorry, but you purchased the
promoted listing back in January, so a refund can't be processed. Can you please

Hello Taylor, Thank you so much for asking! Please note that a regular
subscription doesn't promote your listings. It performs all the other features
that you can access on the settings page. You need to purchase an add-on called
Promoted Listing to promote your listings. I hope you understand. If you still
have any questions, please let me know. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

That is a great explanation. Does the regular subscription continuously share

Hello Taylor, Thank you for getting back to us, You’re correct. The Promote
Listing Subscription is an additional $14.99 monthly fee on top of the regular
$29.99 subscription. This feature is optional and can be canceled at any time.
However, please note that we do not process refunds once you have started using
the service. The Promote Listing Subscription is designed to boost your closet’s
traffic. It promotes your 7 selected listings every day to 1000 closets that
will share your listings throughout the day. You can change these selected
listings anytime as per your preference. This feature has been tested and has
been proven to increase traffic for closets, which often results in increased
sales. It’s a good fit for all niches and can definitely give your closet a
boost. In addition to promoting your listings, the Promote Listing Subscription
also provides an extra 14 auction credits weekly. This means you have more
opportunities to run auctions and potentially increase your sales. I hope this
clarifies your concerns. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Best
regards, Mary

Hi this is something I wanted to use but I was confused on usage and billing. Is
it $14.99 monthly in addition to the $29.00 I already pay monthly? What more

would be interested in more but not wanting to pay too much more. Thanks Taylor

Hi Julia, First off, I have to tell you that I absolutely love Sidekick. Thus
far it has been a game changer for me. I have had more sales in the past two
days than in the past two months, though some not registering on stats; I'm
certain those sales are still the result of Sidekick activity. More importantly
I'm gaining on average 500 - 1000 followers per day which is indirectly driving
me closer to my Ambassador II goal. I just started using Crosslisting. I like
it, but I'm hoping to love it as well once I get more familiar. My only issue
despite my lack of knowledge is that it's slow. I'm thrilled though that I will
be able to list across all of my accounts. With regard to the issue I'm having
with the auctions, I had 6 auctions scheduled and none of them worked. I deleted
them, thinking I did them wrong after they didn't launch; all were scheduled at
different times none overlapped. The only one that is still scheduled that
didn't launch is Women's Fetish - A Silent Event and it was schedule for March
4th at 12:15pm for 45 min. I'm hoping you can tell me I messed up somewhere. I
appreciate your help and I'm definitely looking forward to continuing to work
with you guys. Rodger

Hello Christina, Thank you for reaching out! If you wish to upgrade your
subscription to have more silent shows weekly and add a second closet, here’s
how you can do it: Add More Auction Credits: You can subscribe to promotional
listings which will give you an extra 14 auction credits weekly. The app will
promote your 7 selected listings every day, and there are 1000 closets that will
share your 7 selected listings throughout the day. You can select the 7 items
and the app will promote them every day, but you can also change them anytime.
This feature has been tested and has been proven to create a lot of traffic for

Hello Samantha, Thank you for reaching out! I’m really sorry to hear about the
double charge. Upon checking, it appears that a duplicate subscription was made
on your account on March 2nd and 4th, which caused the double charge. But don’t
worry, I’ve canceled the duplicate subscription and refunded the charge of
$29.99. You should receive it within 5-10 business days. If you have any other
questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask. Best

Hello Carissa, Thank you for bringing this to our attention, I’m really sorry to
hear about the issues you’ve been experiencing with our auction feature. I
understand how frustrating it can be when things don’t work as expected,
especially when it affects your business. I’ve escalated your concerns to our
technical team. They’re currently looking into the issues you’ve described,
including the app freezing and the difficulty in saving new auctions and prices.
As a token of our apology for the inconvenience you’ve experienced, we’ve added
auction credits back to your account. We take your feedback seriously and we’re
always looking for ways to improve our services. Your suggestion for an
“opt-out” option for certain Sidekick services is noted and will be considered
in our future updates. Please bear with us while we work on resolving these
issues. We’ll get back to you as soon as we have an update. Thank you for your
patience and understanding.

Actually I specifically set it to 50% off, to avoid running this. Because you
offer "free" auctions 7x a week with the subscription price that I pay, I
thought I should be doing them. But they almost never work out. I have had one
successful sale in ALL the auctions I've EVER run. They suck up my time and
energy and never work out. When I try to do anything with an auction, the app
turns grey; everything disappears and I have to sit there and wait for it to
regain its composure. Rather than waste time choosing more items to run, I just
run the same ones over and over because when I take the time to set up a new
auction, it won't save, or the prices won't save, or I have to hit the dash keys
to change the prices up or down over and over until my finger feels like it's
going to fall off, and then at the end of all that, it won't save. This is such
a frustrating waste of my time. i wish there were an "opt-out" option for all
the Sidekick services that don't work for me, at a lesser price. Because these
auctions seem like a great idea and I end up in tears after every single one,
including tonight. They make me look stupid, and I can do that all on my own,
without this helping.

Hello Carissa, Thank you for sending the screenshot, Upon checking, the starting
price is set to 0. This is the reason why the app is running the items with
their original prices. Individual pricing is a sub-option for the Starting Price
(Percentage off or Value Type) that you have set up. Once you've configured a
Starting Price for your items, you can edit the prices of listings that you
don't want to run with the Starting Price discount or value. For example:
Starting Price (Percentage off): 20% Individual Pricing: Original Price: $20
Starting Price: -16+ You can edit the listing's starting price of $16
(discounted by 20%). Please note that you need to set up a “Starting Price”
first. After that, you can go to the “Individual Pricing” page to change the
price of specific items. This allows you to have different prices for different
items if needed. If you still have any questions or need any more help, please
don't hesitate to reach out. Kind regards, Mary

I am in the middle of an auction. I set it up to run at 50% off the listed
price. It's running at full price. This was not the intention and it is not
helpful. I cannot seem to change it except by waiting for each item to run
through and manually changing it. I don't have time for this nonsense. This was
a waste of my time to set up, a waste of a credit, it's stressing me out and I
won't make sales this way.

Thanks, I didn't log out and log in because my 7:00 show started on its own.
I'll keep an eye on it. Please issue a credit for the auction that got stuck.

Hello Karen, Thank you for reaching out! It seems that the show is stuck on the
Poshmark website. Please end the show from your Poshmark account. I've refreshed
the app on our end, Please log out and then log back into the app, if the issue
persists kindly follow the steps below. Here are the steps you can take to
resolve this: 1. End the Show from Your Poshmark Account * Log into your
Poshmark account. * Visit your “My Posh Show” page. Here, you can view all your
upcoming live auctions. * If you see any stuck or inactive scheduled auctions,
check if there are options to manually end the show. * After ending the stuck
show, schedule a new show on the Sidekick app and check if the issue has been
resolved. 2. Contact Poshmark Support If the first step doesn’t resolve the
issue: * Log into your Poshmark account if needed. * Look for the “Help Center”
or “Support” option, typically located in the settings or profile section. *
Find a way to contact Poshmark’s customer support, which could be through an
email form, live chat, or a support ticket system. * Describe the issues you’re
facing without mentioning any third-party tools or applications. Focus solely on
the problems you’re encountering like being unable to start/end a live show.
Poshmark’s support team should be able to assist you in resolving these issues
within the Poshmark platform. If you have any questions or need further
assistance with this process, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to
help you get this resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you for your

Megaliths - large prehistoric stone structures - are trending as news comes in
from Peru. An ancient ceremonial megalith

dated to 4,750 years ago, has been unearthed high in the mountains of the
Peruvian Andes. Though the location has been known for some time, the site has
finally been excavated by anthropologists from The University of Wyoming
[https://surge.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b76efcccc1cfba5d0dc240b9c&id=be22721967&e=f63d0870ce].
Radiocarbon dating indicates the "structure was built approximately 100 years
before the Great Pyramids of Egypt and around the same time as Stonehenge," says
project lead Jason Toohey. Sometimes, the hottest trends aren't about anything
new.

Customer S. 15:13 How may I help you today? Customer S. 15:13 Can you please
specify your concern related to billing? Kyler S. 15:16 I had gotten a new debit
card and didn’t update it soon enough when my auto pay for sidekick tried to
charge my card. I added my new card, and paid for this month. I just got an
email saying sidekick tried to charge my old card again and if it wasn’t paid,
my sidekick might be suspended. I also got an email saying that my payment with
my new card went through. Am I okay for this month? Customer S. 15:17 Please let
me check it for you. Kyler S. 15:20 I also couldn’t find a way to set up auto
pay with my new card. Customer S. 15:20 Upon checking, I can confirm that your
subscription is active and fine. Can you please share the last digits of your
card? 15:50 Chat ended due to inactivity at 15:50

Kristie M. 14:21 It seems as though the send offers to likers setting isn't
working. 14:22 Customer S. joined the chat at 14:22 Customer S. 14:23 Hi
Kristie, I'm Ana. Thank you for your email! Customer S. 14:23 I am very sorry to
hear that. Kristie M. 14:25 Is there something I need to do to make sure it's
working? I've had multiple items liked on Poshmark today and no offers sent
Customer S. 14:25 Can you please recheck if you are able to add the offers
details in the settings? I have checked your account and no details for offers
has been added. Kristie M. 14:27 Do the specific details have to be added for
offers to work? Kristie M. 14:27 I did wonder if that was the issue Customer S.
14:28 You need to add the listing discount and shipping discount. Kristie M.
14:29 Ok, I think may not have clicked save Customer S. 14:29 Also, please make
sure to turn off the "Randomize OTL & Relist", to avoid extra delays in sending
offers and relisting of items. Kristie M. 14:29 I did fill that part out
yesterday but I'm not sure that I saved it because those areas were blank just
now Kristie M. 14:31 Oh thank you for that tip! I just turned it off. Will
offers be sent to items that were already liked today or should I do that
myself? Customer S. 14:32 The app can only send offers to likers onwards and
won't be able to send to those who liked earlier today. Customer S. 14:32 Yes,
you need to manually send the offers to them. Kristie M. 14:33 Ok great! Thank
you so much for your help. Customer S. 14:34 You're most welcome, Kristie! Thank
you and have a great day! 😊 15:04 Chat ended due to inactivity at 15:04

Hello Leanna, Thank you so much for reaching out! Upon checking, you are
currently on a soft ban. Please keep in mind that it lasts for about 2-3 hours.
To avoid a soft ban, do not share your closet or add listings while the app is
sharing. This is because Poshmark sometimes considers this to be a high level of
activity in your closet. Please avoid using two sharing services at the same
time. Rest assured that the app will automatically resume sharing once the
restriction is lifted. Also, if you want to work on your closet, please disable
all sharing features to avoid this. I really hope you understand. Have a great
day! Best Regards, Simon

Hi Nancy, Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, editing listing prices

make these adjustments directly through Poshmark instead. If you have any

Hello Nancy! Thank you for reaching out! Please be advised that after selecting
a desired Percentage or Value Starting price for your items, you are also able
to set up individual pricing for your items. To configure individual pricing,
please ensure that you fill out the Starting Price box before proceeding. To
configure individual pricing, please follow these steps: Example: -Fill out the
'Starting Price' box with the value of $20 (preferred value). -Set up individual
pricing for specific listings that you do not want to run at the starting price
of $20. We hope this helps. Best, Kate

Hello- Thank you. I'm confused also about setting up auctions regarding pricing.
I've selected individual pricing and went in and added the start prices. It
won't let me save the auction without adding a starting price for the value. But
then it disregards the prices I have set for each item and runs everything at
say $8 if I've put that for the value price. What am I doing wrong? I've
attached screenshots. Thanks. Inline image

Hello Nancy, I apologize for the inconvenience you’ve experienced. Rest assured,
I’ve already notified our technical team about your concern. Additionally, I’ve
credited your account. To resolve this, please manually end the show in your
Poshmark account and schedule a new one. Before scheduling the new auction, make
sure to update your app, delete it, and then reinstall it. Feel free to reach
out if you continue to encounter the same issue. Thank you! Best regards, Julia

Hello again- It's happened again only this time it failed to run any of my
items. I had a show scheduled for 6:30om EST. I had to run the show manually and
when I kept trying to end the show from the Sidekick app it wouldn't do
anything. Not sure what's going on. Thought I'd let you know. Thanks.

Hello Nancy! Thank you for getting back to us, I’m really glad to hear that you
were able to resolve the issue with your show and that you’re finding our
service helpful. Your feedback is invaluable to us. Your suggestion about having
the listing sit for 15 seconds before the auction begins is a great idea. It
would indeed give viewers a chance to see item details and mimic the experience
of live shows. I’ll make sure to forward this suggestion to our developers.
Regarding the feature you mentioned about conducting a live auction without
being on camera and uploading videos of items ahead of time, we’re still in the
process of testing everything to ensure it works well before we launch it. We
understand how useful this feature could be and we’re working diligently to make
it available as soon as possible. Thank you so much for your kind words and for
sharing your experience with us. We’re here to support you and make your
experience as smooth as possible. If you have any other questions, or
suggestions, or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
Warm regards, Mary

Hello Gail! Thank you so much. Just to let you know, after several attempts I
was able to end the show. I rescheduled a new show for later in the afternoon
and it went fine - no issues at all. I do have a suggestion and I do not know if
it's do-able or not. You have so many updates coming that we are all excited
for! I've noticed when auctioning, the auction begins immediately and then when
it ends, the listing stays for a bit, which is fine. I wondered if it might be a
good idea to have the listing sit for 15 seconds in the beginning before
auctioning, to give the viewer a chance to see item details? We do that at live
shows so we can talk about the item prior to running it. It would kind of mimic
that. One last question - I saw a YouTube video of Sidekick's stating that there
would be a way to do a live auction without being on camera yourself and that we
could upload videos of items ahead of time. Has that launched yet? Seems like a
great idea that so many would love! Thanks a bunch - I know I started out kind
of rocky in the beginning for a while being on and off, but I really am loving
the service. I have a brain injury so I cannot sit there and share and scroll
through listings all the time - it wears me down way too much. This is a
lifesaver and has definitely helped with my sales! Be well - @poshcountry

Hi Tyler, Thank you for your response and for confirming that your concern has
been addressed. Community sharing is a great way to demonstrate support for
others in the Poshmark community, and it can also contribute to positive
interactions. While it may not directly impact your sales as significantly as
self-sharing, every opportunity to increase visibility is valuable. If you have
any other questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach

I apologize there has been some sort of mistake because my card was charged the
amount of 29.99 to posh sidekick on the 1st of March but clearly it was declined
on your end. I am in contact with chime to fix the issue. They may contact you
for proof that you didn't receive the payment. The dispute number is 13023715.
I'm going to go ahead and pay again today so I don't lose my subscription, but I
just wanted to make you aware so that if they do contact you you can let them
know that the payment on march 1st did not go through on your end. Thank you
very much. -ELLYSE Anderson

Hi Jennifer, Thank you for your email! My apologies for the inconvenience that
this has caused you. Please be informed that I have now processed a refund for
the duplicate subscription and payment of $29.99. I just wanted to inform you
that the cause of the other charge is due to a duplicate subscription. I have
canceled the duplicate subscription to avoid other charges. The funds may take
5-10 business days to settle in your account. Thank you so much! Best regards,

Well, Mary. Something MORE is fucked up since I paid on fucking the 23rd and my
account apparently hasn't been working for fucking DAYS and says I don't have an
active subscription or account despite paying for it. So what exactly are you
guys going to do to fix this? And why the fuck does your system say I don't have
an account? I have been emailing non stop about bullshit like this since
December. Wtf is the deal?

And apparently I have credit that could have been put towards my payment. I
tried to log out and log in Wondering f maybe there was a glitch. But nope,
apparently I don’t have an account. Yet I can reset my password no problem. (Yet
still he told I still don’t have an account) AND get a code to log in. This shit
needs to be fixed. Now and for real this time. No more lies from you guys of
“oh, this is just some kind of error… don’t worry about it” clearly. It’s
fucking not.

We know we tend to overanalyze things but we haven't seen you around lately. It
feels like we're moving into un-charter territory...In all seriousness, we
released a bunch of new features in the past few weeks, designed to help you
gain more clarity into your finances and find actionable insights (brand new
HubSpot, Intercom, and Slack integrations, and more robust segmentation). Come
check 'em out and let us know what you think (you can also just reply to this
email). See the improvements

Hello Andrea, Thank you so much for reaching out! I sincerely apologize for
facing this issue. Can you please try to rearrange your closet after turning off
the self-share feature and then take a new snapshot? Once the closet gets out of
order, please try putting it back in order. If your closet is stuck in "putting
closet back in order" again, please inform us right away so that we can
investigate the issue. I really appreciate your cooperation. Looking forward.
Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Hello Saibra, Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I apologize for the
inconvenience this has caused you. It's completely understandable why you're
upset, and I want to assure you that we take your concerns seriously. Upon
investigating the issue further, there was a technical glitch in our system that
resulted in the service not being provided as expected. I'm glad to inform you
that our technical team has resolved the issue. Your closet now is actively
shared and the current activity is self-sharing. To compensate, I've created a
20% discount for you. Please apply this code to your next billing: Saibra20 If
you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Once again, you guys have fucked up. So how long exactly.. have I been paying
for a service. That you guys haven’t been proving? While promising me you’ve
been proving it? Now I’m pissed. I’ve emailed you how many times asking what the
problem is. When I get emails stating issues with my payments. You claimed some
kind of bullshit that I had multible accounts which was a lie. I’ve only ever
had ONE email and ONE poshmark account. And now.. THIS. You better make this
right ONCE AND FOR ALL AND give me a credit.

Hi Julia, The app has been running very slow and sometimes doesn't function
altogether or I have to close it out and restart it. I do like that it saves
time. Sales have been very slow lately and I am trying to cut back on expenses
because it is hard to justify the $30 cost vs. the little profit I'm making. 30%
off would be a great help. Thank you, Grace

Hello Marcela, Thanks for reaching out! Upon checking, your account is stuck in
midnight sharing due to a possible glitch in the recent update. Please be
advised to update your app to a newly released version. Delete or uninstall the
app and download it again from the App Store or Play Store. I have refreshed
your account and it's sharing now. If you continue to encounter the same
problems, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you! Best, Julia

Hello Kevin, Thanks for reaching out! I have checked your account and it appears
that you have a duplicate subscription. Don't worry, I have canceled the other
one and a refund has been processed. image.png

And…more problems. It's my goal to remain supportive, as I am aware you are a
small, family-run group currently in an expansion phase. However, I'm
experiencing a great number of issues. At times (at least half a dozen today),
the app just gives me a blank screen when I attempt to access. The only solution
is to shut down my phone and restart. Can't figure out the issue. At least ten
times, opening the app, the home page is either missing all stats, has stats
from the day before posted, or has incorrect stats (because they are the same as
hours prior) and takes closing and re-opening app for them to reset. In a prior
support email you issued me additional credits for auctions to attempt to fix
the auction glitches. I'm trying to work on that tonight, overnight, when I
should be sleeping. But I missed auctions on Sundays-when people shop. So trying
to get it worked out now. But NOW, my # of auctions has been reset to 0 (zero)
when today they should reset to 7. It's late, and I want to remain a supportive
customer. But there really are so many, so many issues using this app. Please
fix the # of auctions so I can try to fix the auction-related issues. And it
would be excellent to learn the other issues are fixed as well. But I suspect
there is a long list and I don't know where these are in the queue. Hoping you
have the help you need. Best, Jennifer Sent from my iPhone ----------------

Thanks for your reply. But I'm not sure what promo code you're talking about.
This was an error providing feedback re: the customer response you sent to me
earlier in the evening. At the end of your response it asks "was this helpful?"
I clicked "yes" and it gave me a space to write a comment and submit. I did that
and then received this error message. So I am passing along to you info. that
your system for collecting feedback from customer service is sending errors.
Have a good evening. Jenn Sent from my iPhone ---------------- Jennifer L.

Hello Jennifer, Thanks for letting us know! It seems that the form for our promo

your Instagram or Facebook. Once done, please send us a screenshot for
verification and the team will check if it's valid. Rest assured that a discount
code will be provided after. Also, please let us know if you still encounter the
same issue in scheduling your auction. Thank you! Best, Julia

Hello Jennifer, Thanks for reaching out and I apologize for hearing about your
issue. Can you please try to reschedule your show and change the duration time?
At least choose one and a half hour to run all 50 items as we have random delays
between the items to reflect human behavior. Please note that you cannot run 50
items in 15 minutes of the show. I have added credits to your account also.
Kindly schedule a new show that starts tonight and let us know if you still
encounter the same issue. Thank you! Best, Julia

Hi! I’m having the same problem I had a few days ago with the app cutting in and
out when I try to add items to my auction deck. The app glitches and creates
this strobe effect which makes it impossible to add items from my closet. I sent
you a video of the issue last time this happened. In addition, new problems. I
set up an auction and went to save it and the app froze. I restarted my phone,
the app restarted, there was no auction scheduled. I re-did the auction, went
through the strobe/glitchy thing twice, finally got them loaded and got a
message saying I can’t make an auction because I have one scheduled too close in
time already. Checked auction page, none scheduled. Saved and scheduled it for a
farther out time than I planned. Ok. Went to Poshmark, it says I have two
auctions scheduled? I’m so confused. First auction started and ended after a few
minutes. Hoping the second auction actually launches. We shall see! Sent from my

Hello Christine, Thanks for reaching out! Upon reviewing your current settings,
I noticed that your self-sharing option is set to "randomize sharing," which
means the app shares your items randomly. However, the app should not include
sharing items that are already sold. If you notice the same problem, please send
us the link to the item sold so the technical team can investigate it. I also
recommend changing the setting to "share by in reverse." Go to your share
setting ( gear icon in the top left corner of the app). This adjustment will
ensure that the app shares from the bottom to the top of your closet, thereby
avoiding any confusion with sold listings. Thank you! Best, Julia

your closet has been lifted. A soft ban means that your closet is temporarily
blocked from sharing or following by Poshmark due to excessive activity. This
can occur if you manually share or add new items while the app is already
sharing your listings or if you exceed the daily limits set by Poshmark. It's
important to note that this is not a serious issue, and it does not put your
account in any danger. The soft ban is simply an automated action taken by
Poshmark, and it can sometimes trigger without warning for minor reasons. Rest
assured that our app "Posh Sidekick" has built-in safety measures to handle
situations like this, and typically, the issue is resolved within 2 to 3 hours.
To prevent this from happening again, I suggest turning off the sharing features
of the app before sharing or adding new items to your closet. Once you've
finished sharing/adding items, you can then turn the sharing feature back on.
Thank you for your understanding! Sincerely, Dave

Hi, my silent shows were messed up today. I had a one scheduled at 6am and it
ran until I went into Poshmark and manually ended it. It ran for over 11hrs. I
had two other shows that should have run but I do not know if they did or not.
See attached screenshots. Thanks!

Scott H. 15:38 Hello. We were in a 7 day trial and didn’t get any sales. We were
previously on PosherVA and were getting some sales. I know your app does more
things than PosherVA but can you tell me the difference in your audience in
sharing vs PosherVA sharing? 15:40 Customer S. joined the chat at 15:40 Scott H.
15:40 Also, I may have missed it but if I do sign up, can you cancel at anytime
or am I signing up for timeframe Customer S. 15:40 Hi there, I'm Ana. Thank you
for reaching out! Scott H. 15:42 Hello Ana Customer S. 15:43 Please be informed
that we do advise try using the app for at least a month as your closet is
possibly adjusting with our app's activity. Scott H. 15:44 Are you all
experiencing any situations or problems with the new app? What about
CrossListing? I haven’t been able to get setup on a free trial yet. Customer S.
15:45 Are you referring to the merging of Posh Sidekick and Crosslisting? Scott
H. 15:45 Both. When does it merge Customer S. 15:47 It is still in progress as
of this time. So, both apps are still separate right now. We don't have a
specific date when the new app will be able but rest assured that there will be
an announcement once it's released. Customer S. 15:48 I would also like to let
you know that you can avail a free month trial if you can provide a receipt from
PosherVA. Scott H. 15:48 So is the sidekick sharing working well? Scott H. 15:50
I have already provided that receipt and have a code Customer S. 15:51 Yes, it's
working fine. Also, our audience is wide, and the app shares your listings
intelligently at the best times of the day, and to parties, etc. Scott H. 15:51
Ok. We will give it another 30 days and see how it goes. Scott H. 15:51 Thank
you 15:52 Customer left the chat at 15:52 16:22 Chat ended due to inactivity at

Velvet D. 14:58 Hello, I was just looking at my account and it said that I’m
bill 29.99 a month and then at the bottom it said I am billed $14.99 weekly. And
another place it says I am billed $14 and 99 monthly. Velvet D. 14:59 The
regular price is $29.99 correct and then for the promoted listings it’s another
$14.99. Monthly for both of these is that correct? Because it says I am billed
$14.99 weekly. 14:59 Customer S. joined the chat at 14:59 Customer S. 15:00
Hello Velvet, I am Simon. Customer S. 15:00 Thank you so much for reaching out!
Velvet D. 15:00 Hi Simon Customer S. 15:02 Please don't you will be charged
every month. Velvet D. 15:02 Why does it say weekly Customer S. 15:03 The last
$14.99 charge was on February 6. Customer S. 15:03 Now the next renewal is on
March 6. Customer S. 15:03 Can you please share a screenshot? Velvet D. 15:03
But it says weekly and I was wondering why Velvet D. 15:04 I took a screenshot
and it will not let me paste Customer S. 15:04 You can email us. Customer S.
15:04 support@poshsidekick.com [support@poshsidekick.com] Velvet D. 15:04 Yes
sending it now Customer S. 15:04 Thank you! Velvet D. 15:08 Ok I just sent it
Velvet D. 15:09 I accidentally sent it to Poshmark the first time so I had to
resend it to you. I just forwarded it to you. Customer S. 15:10 Please let me
check it. Customer S. 15:10 It must be a glitch in the app. Customer S. 15:11 I
will inform our technical team to fix it. Customer S. 15:12 Don't worry, you
won't be billed weekly. It would be monthly. 15:40 Chat ended due to inactivity

Pamela 14:53 Hi why isn’t sidemark sharing my items?thanks 14:55 Customer S.
joined the chat at 14:55 Customer S. 14:56 Hi Pamela, I'm Ana. Thank you for
contacting us! Customer S. 14:56 I am very sorry for the inconvenience. Pamela
14:56 Hi Ana could you please let me know why sidemark stopped sharing my items
Customer S. 14:58 I have checked your account, and your closet is on Soft Ban.
Rest assured that sharing will resume after 2-3 hours once the restriction is
lifted. I suggest you change your share speed to slow for today, when sharing
resume later. Pamela 14:58 Why is it banned Pamela 14:59 I text someone earlier
and they told me to not list while it was sharing and I also stop ClosetMate. So
I did all that and I still get banned?! Customer S. 15:01 A soft ban means that
your closet is temporarily blocked by Poshmark from sharing or following due to
excessive activity. This can occur if you manually share or add new items while
the app is already sharing your listings, or if you exceed the daily limits set
by Poshmark. It's important to note that this is not a serious issue, and it
does not put your account in any danger. The soft ban is simply an automated
action taken by Poshmark, and it can sometimes trigger without warning for minor
reasons. Rest assured that our app "Posh Sidekick" has built-in safety measures
to handle situations like this, and typically, the issue is resolved within 2 to
3 hours. To prevent this from happening again, I suggest turning off the sharing
features of the app before sharing or adding new items to your closet. Once
you've finished sharing/adding items, you can then turn the sharing feature back
on. Pamela 15:02 Where is this feature I’m on my iphone Customer S. 15:03 It was
still on soft ban due to the activities you have taken earlier today while the
app is sharing and also if ClosetMate is sharing at the same time. Customer S.
15:04 You can see the shares features in the settings page. It's the gear icon
in top left corner of the app. Pamela 15:05 I can’t see it now because I’m on
this with you but I have been trying to figure out how sidemark works and I
don’t believe I saw anything that allows me to turn it off Pamela 15:06 Ok I see
Pamela 15:06 Not the happiest about this Pamela 15:07 I don’t like that sellers
can’t list while sidemark shares not fair Customer S. 15:11 I understand that
you're unhappy, but we don't have any control if Poshmark flags your account.
You can still list but you need to change your share option to slow or turn off
your self-share feature, while working on your closet. Please be aware that we
advised this to keep your account safe and avoid any restrictions by Poshmark.
Since they usually flags accounts with multiple activities. We hope you
understand! 15:12 Customer left the chat at 15:12 15:38 Chat ended due to

self-share feature in the settings page. I have refreshed your account, and the
app is sharing your closet right now. Thank you! Best regards, Ana

I tried to manually end the men's show and it wouldn't end (it kept showing "in
progress"). I tried a couple of times. The other show ran its duration and then
when I went into the auction to see the "stats" on the auction it doesn't show
that screen and it goes back into the set up screen like you are setting up the
auction. The screen shot below is what displays when going into the auction to
see the stats and the blue banner is stuck and displays on the whole app no
matter what screen I go into. Also the 2nd auction I went in on the Posh app and
the starting screen with the countdown clock was all that displayed and the
auction never started or ran my items it was stuck on the countdown clock for
the 3 hour auction that I had set up. I didn't try another auction after these 2
failed. image0.png

My auctions are not running. I had one from this morning (men’s show) and now
items ran. I have another one at 1:05 (shorts, skirts,skirts) that I set up to
run and same thing it’s not running. I went into the auction on Posh and it is
frozen not displaying items… would this be a posh issue or Sidekick? Thanks.

checked your account, and your closet was on soft ban. However, the restriction
has been lifted and the app was able to share your closet already. Customer S.
11:54 Kindly be advised not to share your closet or add listings while the app
is sharing to avoid Soft ban. This is because Poshmark sometimes counts this as
a lot of activity in your closet. 11:55 Customer left the chat at 11:55 12:19

Pamela A. 11:15 How do I cancel my subscription and unlink my closet? 11:16
Customer S. joined the chat at 11:16 Customer S. 11:16 Hello Pamela, I am Simon.
Customer S. 11:17 Thank you so much for reaching out! Customer S. 11:17 We are
grateful that you picked up Sidekick services for your Poshmark closet. Would
you mind letting us know the reason for your cancellation? If you are facing any
issues, we can assist you and resolve them. Pamela A. 11:22 I have had numerous
soft bans. I did all of the things that were recommended. I turned off sharing
and gave it a break. I turned it back on this morning and it was stopped before
anything was shared. I have had ZERO problems with the other service I used, so
I am returning to that service. I am concerned that I will lose my account if I
continue with Sidekick. Please tell me how to unsubscribe. Customer S. 11:25 Can
you please let me know if other services are active along with Sidekick? Pamela
A. 11:27 No other sharing services Customer S. 11:27 I understand your
frustration. Please give us one more chance to fix it. I would like to offer you
a 30% refund because of this inconvenience. Pamela A. 11:29 Thank you, but no. I
would like to cancel. It’s not worth the loss of my business. Customer S. 11:31
Thank you so much for the confirmation, Pamela! Customer S. 11:31 Please send me
a confirmation email. Customer S. 11:33 If you want me cancel it on your behalf.

Message: Hello, I have a question concerning my monthly subscription. I thought
I was enrolled in auto pay, wich would renew tomorrow, but it looks like my
subscription is inactive as of today. So I'd like to make sure I have the right
payment information so I won't be billed twice again this month. Also I
participated in the Valentine listing promotion in February and was issued a
discount code for my next payment of 20 or 25%, I think it was. Sorry for the
confusion, I just want to get back on track with my subscription and auto pay(
with my discount code) I love this app, thank you. --- Date: March 3, 2024 Time:

Customer S. 09:33 Can you please try to end the show? Then schedule a new one.
Customer S. 09:33 May I know the duration of the show that failed to to run?
Andrew M. 09:35 I did end the show via the app Andrew M. 09:35 But it’s still
running Customer S. 09:35 Can you confirm if you ended it on the Posh Sidekick
app? Andrew M. 09:37 And I can’t go into the sidekick app while I have this chat
running it appears Customer S. 09:38 You can minimize this chat. Andrew M. 09:38
Nvm figured it out Andrew M. 09:38 I ended the auction via the sidekick app

Hello Devon, I hope you are doing great! I have heard back from the technical
team regarding your offer issue. As per the team, the offer was not sent because
the shipping discount set on the App is not applicable to these items. Your
offers were sent to other items fine. You can send the offer to these items
manually. I really hope you understand. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Hi Djilly, Thank you for your email! I am very sorry to hear that all of your
items did not run completely. Please be advised to at least choose one and half
hour to run all the 50 items. This is because the app has random delay between
the items to reflect human behavior. I hope this helps! Best regards, Ana

follow and unfollow features at the same time. The app will unfollow people
based on what you set on the Unfollow option. You can also unfollow accounts
that are conducting Live. If you are still confused or need assistance, please

Hello Andrea, Thank you so much for reaching out! I sincerely apologize for the
inconvenience. Can you please share a screenshot of the error pop-up when you
try to comment on our Facebook group? We will take a look and assist you. Please
don't worry, we are receiving your emails. Yes, we are going to merge Sidekick
and Crosslisting app but the process is still in progress. No, the pricing will
stay the same and there will be no increase in price. If you are still confused
or need assistance, please let me know. Have a great day! Best Regards Simon

Hello. For some reason I can no longer comment or ask questions on the Facebook
group. I don't know what's going on I couldn't even message you so my question
is in regard to the Crosslisting and the Posh Sidekick are these two separate
apps that are working together?like two separate fees that talk to each other?
It's all new to me. Thank you for clarifying. Regards, Andrea L. McCoy (972)

Hi Sarah, Thank you for your email! My apologies for the inconvenience that this
has caused you. Please be informed that I have now processed a refund for the
duplicate subscription and payment of $29.99. I just wanted to inform you that
the cause of the other charge is due to duplicate subscriptions. I have already
canceled the duplicate subscription so it won't renew. However, we cannot
process a refund for the duplicate subscription for January 31, 2024, as you
have already submitted a dispute for it. Please cancel the dispute and rest
assured that we will process the refund. image.png

Hello Eva, Thanks for reaching out! Upon checking, it appears that you have
resubscribed and your current subscription failed the previous days and it
automatically charged upon updating your card information. Please don't worry, I
have processed the refund and canceled the other subscription. The amount should
appear in your account within 5 to 10 business days. image.png

Hello Jenee, I'm sorry to hear about your experience with our app, and I
appreciate you sharing your reasons for canceling your subscription. It's
important for us to know how we can improve our services to better meet our
user's needs. Also, I would like to inform you that we have settings where you
can set up specific categories/ items to be shared and features that you can
enable to make sure that items will be shared with the party. You can also keep
the arrangement of your closet by enabling the closet snapshot. We also provide
a guide also, so users can easily navigate app features. If you ever decide to
give Sidekick another try in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out to
us. We'd be happy to offer you a 30% discount code to welcome you back. Thank
you for your feedback, and we wish you all the best in your Poshmark journey!

Hello I liked the way it shared my closet throughout the day I didn't like that
I put it on "fast" and it only shared 6k I would rather it have shared 10k It
didn't seem to share the relevant items to the parties (whenever I would go into
a party to see if my items were shared I wouldn't see them) I don't like that
you can't choose which listings get shared and it jumbles up your closet But
most importantly $29 is just not worth it. If my sales skyrocketed from using
the app I would continue for $29 but they didn't There is another app called
closet pilot that shares your closet for $8 a month

I haven't signed up to Posh Sidekick because of fear of technical ineptness! Now
you are adding cross listing! I only use my phone. Will I need a computer? Will
you have a tutorial for dummies? How about a trial period. Frozen in AZ. Connie

Hi Simon, unfortunately, I won't be renewing my plan with crosslister -
primarily as the app is a nightmare to use currently - possibly this is a blip
but it was a 3 week effort of logging in and out, deleting and reloading the
app….. I will begin again when it merges with Sidekick and the kinks are worked
out. I will use the 30% code when I renew. I've gone into my subscription and am
unable to cancel (or possibly it was only for 30 days - cannot really tell). Can
you advise? Thank you. Pario Logo

Good morning Sidekick - gosh I cant be the only one signing out, signing in,
deleting the app multiple times (Crosslister) - it functions sometimes then
today not at all. It has loaded duplicates and allowed me to upload duplicates -
it won't load my inventory, wont let me do anything. Plus, every item has the
tag words combined into one word so they all have to be fixed manually. Given
I've paid for a set period and uploads, can you advise why this is so
ridiculously bad? To the point - I won't be renewing but finding another
crosslister. Love sidekick - hate crosslister! Sorry, paying for a service
that's less than 20% effective - you guys are great but it isnt changing the
apps issues. Regards Pario Logo

Hello Karianne, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you confirm if you have updated your

the app and download it from the App Store or Play Store. The promoted listings
are not included in your subscription, you have to subscribe separately. Also,
can you try to subscribe again, after you reinstall the app? Let me know if you
experience the same problem. Thank you! Best, Julia

Hello Meagen, I apologize for any inconvenience caused. I have already forwarded
your concern to our technical team, and they will investigate the issue. Rest
assured that I will keep you informed and provide an update as soon as we
receive a response. In the meantime, can you please ensure that you are using
the latest version of the app? And try to relink your closet. Here's how to
relink: Go to Profile Page click Switch Closet and Swipe left to Unlink> Relink
Please note that unlinking and relinking your closet will remove the current
insights in your app. After that, please schedule a new show and let us know if
you are still experiencing the same problem. I have also added 2 credits to your

It's been a while this has been an issue. I've noticed i stopped making sales
because of it. Repeat buyers will bid on one or two items (not the normal 5-20)
but now it makes sense of why they wouldn't stick around if the show is
restarting from the beginning. I ended up taking over the auction manually
because I had someone buying from me. It was my latest auction Vintage to modern
pearl and crystal

When someone wins an auction I'm still having the issue with the auction
starting back at the beginning. Example: if it's on item 20 and someone bids and
wins it doesn't go to item 21. It goes back to item 1.

Hi, thank you for your patience I am new to this. I stopped listing and I see
again it's not sharing my items. I saw that I was sharing other people items
about 13 minutes ago. Does it share mine and then others or am I pressing
something to make this happen? Also, why has it stopped completely again? I stop
my other bot from ClosetMate about an hour ago so why would sidemark stop
sharing my items again. This is disappointing and frustrating that it stops
sharing my items and I have to worry about this when I paid good money for it to
share my items. Could you explain?Thanks

Hello Pamela, Thank you so much for asking! You can add new items, but you can
disable the self-share feature from the Sidekick app's settings page or set the
sharing speed to slow. The main goal is to prevent the Poshmark from detecting
excessive activity in your closet. I hope you understand. If you are still
confused or need assistance, Please let me know. Have a great day! Best Regards,
Simon

So I can't work and add listings while side marks shares? I'm not sure I
understand? I got sidemark so I could work list and not worry about sharing. I
didn't know this is how it works it doesn't make sense to me. So do I log out
each time I go to list an item? Thank you

Hello Pamela, Thank you so much for reaching out! Upon checking, your closet was
on a soft ban. Please keep in mind that it lasts for about 2–3 hours. To avoid a
soft ban, do not share your closet or add listings while the app is sharing.
This is because Poshmark sometimes considers this to be a high level of activity
in your closet. Please avoid using two sharing services at the same time. I
confirm that your restriction has been lifted already and your closet is now
being shared. Please check it out now. Yes, our app will be sharing contacts,
except the app is not performing any other activity. I hope you understand. Have
a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Hello Linda, Thanks for sharing a screenshot. I'm sorry to hear that today's
relisted log didn't show any items for now. The technical team is working to fix
it. And I can assure you that the app relisted your items for today. Thank you!

Madison S. 14:33 Why did my app stop 14:33 Customer S. joined the chat at 14:33
Customer S. 14:33 Hello Madison, I am Simon. Customer S. 14:33 Thank you so much
for reaching out! Customer S. 14:34 I am sorry for the issue, please let me
check it. Madison S. 14:35 K Customer S. 14:35 Upon checking, you are currently
on a soft ban. Please keep in mind that it lasts for about 2-3 hours. To avoid a
soft ban, do not share your closet or add listings while the app is sharing.
This is because Poshmark sometimes considers this to be a high level of activity
in your closet. Please avoid using two sharing services at the same time.
Customer S. 14:35 Please change your sharing speed to slow. Customer S. 14:36
Your closet is small and not eligible for fast sharing speed. Madison S. 14:36
Okay thanks Customer S. 14:36 Rest assured that the app will automatically
resume sharing once the restriction is lifted. Also, if you want to work on your
closet, please disable all sharing features to avoid this. 14:36 Customer left

Hello Lauren, Thank you so much for reaching out! I sincerely apologize for
facing this issue. Please note that you need to add at least 7 to 10 listings to
your account in order to turn on the self-share setting. Please add more

Thanks for your response. I never could get signed up. Or log in. I deleted to
try again. It keeps saying my email address is already taken. That’s me. And it
also says something about a previous account or something with another company
or user? I’ve never used anything else. I’m on Poshmark. That’s all. I get a
code. My password doesn’t work. Can’t find where to change it. Yes, I’m
technologically challenged. I’m so frustrated. I really want to try this and see
if it will help me with my Poshmark business. I have problems even using that. I
would like to try Posh Sidekick if I can learn how to use it. Or even get it. I
need some kind of VERY BASIC step by step tutorial for both apps. There seems to
be only a list of general questions one might ask to choose from on Poshmark.
But never the one I have. If there’s anything you can suggest I do, I would love
to try again. Hope to hear from you. Thank you so much Jana Walsh Have a blessed
day! 😇

Hello Veronica, Thanks for getting back to us! I apologize for the
miscommunication. Can you try to follow the steps below and link your closet? Go
to the Profile button at the bottom of the screen. Tap on ‘Switch Closet’.
You’ll see a ‘+’ button at the lower part of the screen. Tap on it. Link your
closet name without the ‘@’ symbol and type it in all lowercase letters. Let me
know if it works or not. Thank you! Best, Julia

Hi Ana, I forgot the crosslister app has depop. I unsubscribed due to it
unsynching regularly and I had to uninstall and reinstall the app too much.
Maybe I'll try it again when the two apps get meshed! Thank you the prompt

Michelle, Guess what? We've got some BIG news, and I'm here to spill the beans
for those who might have missed out. (No worries, we know life's busy!) 😉
Drumroll, please... 🥁 We announced the BIG MERGE of Posh Sidekick and
Crosslisting into a single, powerful app we're now calling SIDEKICK! 🎉 Yep! You
heard it right. It's all about making your life easier and your business
booming. Like I said last night. "We wanna see you get to the next level!"
Everyone in the live was excited. Someone says."Uh-oh! Feels the pressure to
actually cross list!". But that was a good pressure! Who shouldn't be right?
That's the sign to make more money! I'll be sharing some snapshots of these
exciting and heartwarming comments from our live session. (Make sure to check
them out below!📸) But wait, there's more! We got some really great questions
during the live, and I thought, why not answer them again right here for
everyone? 1. One app to rule them all? Absolutely! Post-merge, there will only
be one app (SIDEKICK). 2. What about the billing? Simplicity is key. Just one
bill for everything. We're smoothing out the details as we speak. 3. Is
Magiscriptor sticking around? You bet! Our handy title and description generator
isn't going anywhere. 4. An update or a new app? It's all happening via an
update to the Posh Sidekick app. Seamless transition! 5. Can they run
simultaneously? 100% yes! Efficiency at its best. Here are some little snippets
of the love and excitement we felt from you all.

I had continuous problems with the service dropping the second closet and my
having to manually add it again. While you did finally find a way to notify me
that this was happening, it did not resolve the issue and by the time I had
received notice of it or could act on it, I had lost what I consider valuable
time in sharing my closet. For the price, that shouldn't be happening.

Hello Camelia, Thank you so much for asking! Yes, Sidekick works in Canada as
well. If your closet name is not working, please try linking it using your
Poshmark email address and password. If you still encounter the same issue,
please try to log out of the Sidekick app and then re-login. You will be
prompted to the closet linking screen by the app. To locate the logout option,
navigate to the profile page. Kindly don't use @ at the start of your closet
name and use a lowercase letter of your closet name. If you still encounter the
same issue, please let us know. I hope you find it useful. Have a great day!

Tima M. 10:57 Hi My closet stopped sharing Tima M. 10:57 I was trying to try
crosslisting app Tima M. 10:58 Is that the app to use for the free trial? 10:59
Customer S. joined the chat at 10:59 Customer S. 10:59 Hello Fatima, I am Simon.
Customer S. 10:59 Thank you so much for reaching out! Tima M. 11:00 Hi Customer
S. 11:01 Please note that for cross-listing, you need to download a seperate app
called Crosslisting. Customer S. 11:01 https://crosslisting.com/
[https://crosslisting.com/] Customer S. 11:01 Please visit the following link to
download Crosslisting app. Customer S. 11:06 Upon checking, you are currently on
a soft ban. That's why you closet is not being shared. Please keep in mind that
it lasts for about 2-3 hours. To avoid a soft ban, do not share your closet or
add listings while the app is sharing. This is because Poshmark sometimes
considers this to be a high level of activity in your closet. Please avoid using
two sharing services at the same time. Customer S. 11:06 Rest assured that the
app will automatically resume sharing once the restriction is lifted. Also, if
you want to work on your closet, please disable all sharing features to avoid
this. Tima M. 11:08 Thank You Customer S. 11:11 You're most welcome, Fatima!

Hello Jennifer, Thank you so much for reaching out! Please note that Sidekick is
not the cause of this issue. There must be an issue with Poshmark that is
causing issues when creating new listings. The Poshmark support team can assist
you in this case. I hope you understand. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

Amanda, Guess what? We've got some BIG news, and I'm here to spill the beans for
those who might have missed out. (No worries, we know life's busy!) 😉 Drumroll,
please... 🥁 We announced the BIG MERGE of Posh Sidekick and Crosslisting into a
single, powerful app we're now calling SIDEKICK! 🎉 Yep! You heard it right.
It's all about making your life easier and your business booming. Like I said
last night. "We wanna see you get to the next level!" Everyone in the live was
excited. Someone says."Uh-oh! Feels the pressure to actually cross list!". But
that was a good pressure! Who shouldn't be right? That's the sign to make more
money! I'll be sharing some snapshots of these exciting and heartwarming
comments from our live session. (Make sure to check them out below!📸) But wait,
there's more! We got some really great questions during the live, and I thought,
why not answer them again right here for everyone? 1. One app to rule them all?
Absolutely! Post-merge, there will only be one app (SIDEKICK). 2. What about the
billing? Simplicity is key. Just one bill for everything. We're smoothing out
the details as we speak. 3. Is Magiscriptor sticking around? You bet! Our handy
title and description generator isn't going anywhere. 4. An update or a new app?
It's all happening via an update to the Posh Sidekick app. Seamless transition!
5. Can they run simultaneously? 100% yes! Efficiency at its best. Here are some
little snippets of the love and excitement we felt from you all.

Hi Christine, Thank you for your email! Upon checking, your Promoted listing
subscription already renewed today, however the sharing service subscription is
set to renew on the 5th, and we can't adjust it as it is fixed. What you can do
is to cancel your subscription then resubscribe today. Thank you! Best regards,
Ana

Hi Tracey, Thank you for your email! As of this time, you will need to download
the Crosllsting app separately as the merge is still ongoing. There will be no
changes in the price so far. Yes, the crosslisting have a smart fill feature in
which it generates everything, Title, Descriptions etc. primary and required
fields. You can also check the replay of the recent announcement for more
details about the merge: Announcement Replay

Hi, I only have the posh sidekick app, do I need to download the cross listing
app as well? Did I hear correctly that you will now have an auto list AI type
option? I just need to take the photos & measurements then you do the rest? If
so, I'm very interested in that - is that an additional cost? Thank you Tracey

I subscribe to the new app and cancel crosslist? Customer S. 09:11 If you
subscribed to Posh Sidekick, you would get free crosslisting. It actually

Hello Maya, Thank you so much for reaching out! I apologize for the
inconvenience. If your closet name is not working, please try linking it using
your Poshmark email address and password. If you still encounter the same issue,
please try to log out of the Sidekick app and then re-login. You will be
prompted to the closet linking screen by the app. To locate the logout option,
navigate to the profile page. Kindly don't use @ at the start of your closet
name and use a lowercase letter of your closet name. If you still encounter the
same issue, please let us know. I hope you find it useful. Have a great day!
Best Regards, Simon

Hi! I'm not yet cross-listing but I would love to use the listing generating
option like Tabs talked about on her YouTube blog. Can I use it just to create
listings? I'm not ready for the next step until I can generate listings quicker.
Thank you so much. Lucie On Sat, Mar 2, 2024, 6:06 AM Posh Sidekick wrote: >

Hi Missy, Thank you for your email! My sincerest apologies for the
inconveniences this have caused you. Kindly confirm if you're able to update
your Crosslisting app to the latest version? While regarding the issue you've
encountered for the silent show and offers not being sent. Please try to unlink
and relink your closet, then reset your offers details, and schedule a new show.
Here's how to unlink: Go to Profile Page > Click Switch Closet > Swipe left to
Unlink Please note that unlinking and relinking your closet will remove the
current insights in your app. If the same issue occurs, please do let us know
with a screenshot, so we can further investigate. Thank you! Best, Ana

Good afternoon, Simon: Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. These issues
have been going on for months now. On mercari - my listings that are relisted
are missing pictures. I continue to get an error message when I try to crosslist
and have to manually list each item. Also, items that have sold will end up
relisting. I basically have to go through my mercari daily to search for errors.
On ebay - once I list something through the crosslisting app - I am not able to
edit them in anyway. I can't change the price, or change or add pictures, etc. I
have to delist and "sell similar." However, once I do that, it takes away the
number of listings that I can sell on ebay. Since I have had the app and listed
on ebay - I haven't made one sale. On kidizen - I also get error messages,
though not as many as mercari. Once the app relists an item for me, the pictures
are not clear (blurry) and have a green tone. I have no other choice but to
delete and make a whole new listing. But that deducts from my amount of listings
on the app (which is not fair). It also is time consuming. Also, if I "hide" a
listing as inactive, the app still relists it. So, if I don't search everyday to
look for items the app lists that should not be there - they are listed for
sale. This results in items being at risk of being sold that aren't available
for sale. I can't even remember the last time I made a sale on kidizen.
Additionally, on posh sidekick when I schedule a silent show and add my starting
prices to the listings - once the show starts - my prices are gone and I have to
manually go into the show and do it all over again. Additionally, the shows
freeze and it takes long to move from item to item. People leave my show due to
it freezing and they don't come back. In all the shows I had - I've only made
one sale. Furthermore, many times offers aren't sent after someone likes my item
and I have to search everyday from the night before to see what items were not
sent offers to the liker and send offers manually. These are the main issues.
Thank you. Best Regards, Missy

Hello Missy, Thank you so much for reaching out! I really appreciate you sharing
your detailed concern with us. I sincerely apologize for all the issues you have
faced. Can you please write down all the cross-listing issues that you are
currently facing right now? I will raise it to the technical team so that they
can fix it. Please note that our technical team has released a new version of
the app so please uninstall your app and reinstall it from the store. Because of
this inconvenience, I have processed a full refund for March. It will be
credited back to your account within 5 to 10 working days. Please don't worry,
if we are going to combine two apps then we will find a better solution for all
the issues. I hope it's fine now. Looking forward. Have a great day! Best

Good morning, I pray all is well with you. I am reaching out to you after
watching the video on YouTube about the combining the 2 apps. I have a
subscription for both apps and though I do understand that glitches and updates
happen at times, I've had a lot of issues with both apps. More so, the
crosslisting app than sidekick. I've reached out to the crosslisting team quite
a few times and am awaiting their response. I informed them of the various
issues that I am having and continue to have. I also expressed to them how I am
not compensated for these issues and still charged each month, which I find
unfair because I am not getting what I pay for. They informed me that upon
resolving the issues, they would discuss compensation. However, it's been weeks
with no resolution and I was charged again today. Additionally, it seems like in
the mornings the crosslisting app just doesn't work. I cannot list. It basically
just freezes. I will enter all the information for multiple sites and it does
not list, and/or it will list to one or 2 of the sites and I have to manually
list my stuff myself to other sites. I just get an error message when I try to
list to the other sites. Thus, it doesn't keep track of the listing on each site
because I manually list on some of the sites due to the error message. I do
understand that things happen but I also find it unfair as a loyal customer that
when things happen - I still pay full price each month. Lastly, I was originally
charged one amount when I signed up for crosslisting and then it increased with
no warning for the same amount of listings. Some clarity on everything would be
nice. I know that you guys are doing your best. I am just letting you know the
issues I've been having since signing up. Especially, since combining the apps
will most likely not be a smooth transition. I appreciate the convenience of not
having to share all day, and the relisting feature. Those are the 2 reasons that
I am hanging in there. I know that there are other apps but I have always been a
loyal person, especially when I see that you do your best to be transparent and
are relatable to our needs. Hopefully, with this long email - it will bring some
insight to bugs that need to be fixed. Have a Blessed day! Thank you. Best
Regards, Missysblessings

Hi, That's awesome, but I can't help to be worried about prices. With the actual
economy and sales at the lowest point I'm already struggling with the payment of
a subscription for my 3 closets, sadly I don't think I can't really afford
paying more… Diana Diana Marrero > Le 2 mars 2024 à 06:06, Posh Sidekick a écrit

Hi poshsidekick.com, Since you didn't submit evidence, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
- Debit decided in their customer's favor for the $29.99 USD dispute that Holly
Chafey started on February 4, 2024. The dispute was created because the customer
said they were charged after they canceled a subscription. DISPUTE INFORMATION
Dispute ID du_1Og6WpFAgxGOpyBogykOLs8B Customer Holly Chafey Reason Subscription

Disputes are a part of doing business online, but knowing that doesn't make them
any less frustrating to deal with. Unfortunately, once a bank decides that
you've lost a dispute, that decision is final. It seems you did not submit
evidence for this dispute. Remember that submitting evidence is your only chance
to win a dispute and recover your funds. Be sure to check our guides
[https://58.email.stripe.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fstripe.com%2Fdocs%2Fdisputes%2Fcategories%23dispute-category-types/1/0100018dff462413-d1e892d0-0dc4-4496-b94a-e7ec374531b9-000000/F__FbyogIzqhAX0p4nYRb2AeS7GQpN-2K8HfzVTrFZA=342]
on how to submit the best evidence possible for each dispute reason. If you'd
like to know more about why you lost this particular dispute, the issuer has
provided some documentation with their decision that may shed some light on
their reasoning. You can view it on your Dashboard

Hi there, unfortunately, I am still seeing lots of errors throughout the app
when I am attempting to import and Crosslist on a daily basis, I have been
seeing this one for the last couple of days even since the last update to the
app a couple of days ago. I just got this about five minutes ago when I try to
import 16 listings over from eBay. image0.jpeg

Hi there, I wanted to touch base to see if there is any updates on this issue
there are intermittent times where I am able to access my listings in order to
Crosslist, but it seems like the majority of the time when I try to access the
app to work on Crosslisting my inventory is showing zero listings despite having
Listings show up in the main dashboard section. Please see attached screenshots.

Hey Simon, I probably have another day or two to give before my workload would
get too far behind, I'd love to stick around if we can get this resolved! :)
Another issue I noticed if/when imported listings do load it takes a very long
time to load OR it throws that 60000 error again. Also another thing I noticed
is that when you crosslist an item, and then click to run in the back ground and
you move on to your next item to crosslist, the previously running back ground
item pops up with its "completed prompt" but when it does it then wipes out all
the feilds you have populated so far on the next listing your working on and you
must start over again. Thank you so much for escalating these issues, I really
appreciate it! Thanks! Staci

Hi again, I am still unable to use this tool for Crosslisting purposes, I've
been having to move eBay listings over each day at a time because there is no
option to bulk import all of my 2400 listings as I was told there was
functionality to do so. This morning I attempted Crosslist the 18 listings that
I put into eBay yesterday. However, that's not even loading right now I'm
getting a blank screen with an error message at the bottom. Please see
screenshot for details. The Crosslisting side of things does not seem to be very
stable at this time. Wondering if I can please get a refund for Crosslisting
only. am happy and content with other sidekick products that I have been a
long-term customer of, but the Crosslisting does not seem to be stable enough
for high-volume sellers. I have been attempting to get it to work all weekend
long as you can see from this email string. Once things are ironed out, I would
love to come back for a holistic product, including Crosslisting as that was my
primary goal! Any chance I can get a refund until things are sorted out? I just
joined the Crosslisting site a few days ago again. Thank you, Staci Boswell

Thank you so much for confirming for me, sadly, I was hoping to get all of my
eBay listings over from the last several years as I have been on eBay for many
many years, it sounds like this is going to be more of a manual undertaking than
I was hoping. But I really appreciate your responsiveness and for the update! I
will give importing more of a try going into this upcoming week, and I will let
you know if I run into additional issues. Thank you, Staci Boswell

Hello Staci, I hope you are doing great! I am here to update you regarding the
import issue you were encountering. I have heard back from the technical team,
and as per the team, this error message is from the eBay API. Actually, eBay
limits the time ranges to less than 120 days when getting items' lists. Please
select the range which is less than 120 days and then try to import. Let's
suppose you want to import items from Nov 1 in 2023, you can split the date
range to Nov 1, 2023 - Jan 1, 2024, and then in 2nd try choose Jan 2 - March 3.
I hope you understand. If you are still confused or need assistance, please let
me know. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

I'm so sorry for following up again but I'm Unable to Crosslist at all now after
moving to Sidekick, from List Perfectly. All instances that I try importing time
out and throw an error when attempting to import whether it's "all" or just
yesterday date range nothing loads. I can't even get just yesterday's new
listings to import let alone my 2400 listings on eBay. I've also attempted to
get Poshmark to load an import and it just spins and throws a time out error
also. This is all from the mobile app. Is the app experiencing issue? if no
projected fix today I'll need to see if a refund is possible as we are high
volume and need to keep up with our Crosslisting daily without errors. Please
advise. Thank you, Staci

Hello Staci, Thank you so much for reaching out! Please note that we have the
Import All feature on the Import page. 120 days are start and end date range. So
you can modify it as well. You can import the last 120 days and then you can set
the start date as the old 120 days ago. I hope it's fine now. If you are still
confused or need assistance, please let me know. Have a great day! Best Regards,

Hi there! I was curious to see what the best approach is to bringing in all 2400
items in my eBay account into Crosslisting? It looks like it only allows me to
go 120 days back when I try to import. Is there a mass import option to bring
them all in by chance? Would love to bring them all in so that analytics are
accurate for sales. Thank you so much in advance! Thank you, Staci

Hello Sonia, Thank you so much for reaching out! I apologize for the
inconvenience. If your closet name is not working, please try linking it using
your Poshmark email address and password. If you still encounter the same issue,
please try to log out of the Sidekick app and then re-login. You will be
prompted to the closet linking screen by the app. To locate the logout option,
navigate to the profile page. Kindly don't use @ at the start of your closet

Hi Simon, it's me again. I'm still having issues with my silent shows ☹️ I had
scheduled the show to run for 1 hour. It ran for 3 hours and 19 minutes. 🙃, and
it only showed 12 items 😳. Twenty-five people to my show and no sales. Not sure
what is going on. Could you help me please. Thanks Ana 18e035ff758d37d122e1

LMBALFOUR@LIVE.CA 23:30 App says to contact Posh Sidekick support 23:31 Customer
S. joined the chat at 23:31 Customer S. 23:31 Hello there Customer S. 23:31
thank you for reaching out! Customer S. 23:31 please let me check
LMBALFOUR@LIVE.CA 23:31 Ok Customer S. 23:32 Your account was on a soft ban.
LMBALFOUR@LIVE.CA 23:32 Oh ok Customer S. 23:32 I’ve refreshed your account on
our end and it has resumed sharing. If it’s not reflecting on your end, please
try logging out and then back into your app. Customer S. 23:32 A soft ban means
that your closet is temporarily blocked from sharing or following by Poshmark
due to excessive activity. LMBALFOUR@LIVE.CA 23:32 Ok, thank you Customer S.
23:32 A soft ban might sound alarming, but it’s just an automated action taken
by Poshmark and can sometimes be triggered for minor reasons. But don’t worry,
our app, “Posh Sidekick”, has built-in safety measures to handle situations like
this. Typically, the issue is resolved within 2 to 3 hours. Customer S. 23:32 To
prevent this from happening again, I suggest turning off the sharing features of
the app before sharing or adding new items to your closet. Once you’ve finished
sharing or adding items, you can then turn the sharing feature back on. Customer
S. 23:33 You're most welcome! 23:33 Customer left the chat at 23:33 00:03 Chat

Hi, a pair of salt and pepper shakers sold. I have a $7minimum for offers. This
was a total price of $6 with $2.20 shipping discount so I know it was an offer.
I made $1.03 on the sale. I don't understand how this happened.

Hi, I noticed my posh activity stopped for a while, so I went to the sidekick
app and I cannot open it in either iPad or iPhone. It just goes to a white
screen. I checked for an update on the App Store, but I seem to be up to date.
Thanks for your help, Karyn

Hello Traci, Thank you for reaching out about this issue! It sounds like you've
already updated the Posh Sidekick app, so you can disregard the horn emoji
notification. The pop-up message is simply informing you that there's a new
version available, but since you've already updated, you're all set! If you have
any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. Best
regards, Julia

Hi, I have the horn emoji at the top of my page which says to update the app. It
does not allow me to do it though. I also checked the App Store on my phone and
it says the posh sidekick app has been updated on Feb 28th . I’m not sure why
the horn emoji is still on my home page . Any suggestions for me to do to remove
that? I appreciate it !;) Traci Delso

Hello Marsha, Thank you for reaching out! I understand your concern about the
potential additional charges with the introduction of cross-listing. Here’s what
you need to know: As a Sidekick subscriber, you’re entitled to the following
free features: * 25 free cross-listing credits per month * 20 free relistings on
Mercari and Depop per day * An additional 50 cross-listing credits if you
subscribe to any of our cross-listing packages Please note that these features
are included in your subscription at no extra cost. You will not be charged for
cross-listing unless you specifically subscribe to it. I hope this clarifies
your concern. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please
don’t hesitate to ask. Best regards, Mary

Hello Sue, Thank you for reaching out! Upon checking your account, everything
seems to be in order and the app is sharing your listings as expected. However,
if these updates are not reflecting on your end, I recommend trying the
following steps: 1. Log out of the app. 2. Close the app completely. 3. Reopen
the app. 4. Log back in from the app’s profile page. 1.png

Hello Dayna, Thank you for reaching out! I’m sorry to hear about the trouble
you’ve been experiencing with your subscription charges. I’ve looked into your
account and here’s what I found: * On January 9, there were 4 subscription
attempts. Three of these went through and one was cancelled. * In February,
there were 5 subscription attempts. One successful transaction occurred on
February 9, and four attempts were made on February 11, with one being
successful and three failing. 1.png

I’ve attached a screenshot for your reference. Please don’t worry, I’ve taken
immediate action to rectify this. I’ve canceled the duplicate subscriptions and
processed refunds for the two extra charges in January (29.99 x 2) and one extra
charge in February (29.99). You should receive your refund within 5-10 business
days. Your subscription is now in good standing until March 11, 2024. I
appreciate your understanding regarding this matter. If you have any further
questions or need additional assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Hey Dalton, Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to reach out and say we're big
fans of your YouTube content ! We've got something exciting happening at Posh
Sidekick, and I think you'd be interested. We've got this awesome feature on
Poshmark called Automated Live Auction. It's been around for a while, but we
think you'd be perfect to share it with your audience. Here's what's in it for
you: 1. Earn Big: Get a 15% commission on every referral for life! 2. Easy
Earnings: Make $0.50 for every free trial sign-up using your code. We're
offering you a two-week risk-free trial of Posh Sidekick, no obligations or
charges. And if you're interested, we're open to discussing a paid
collaboration. Just share your media kit with us! If this sounds good to you,

Hi Julianna, I hope this email finds you well! I'm loving your incredible
contents and as someone who values efficiency and productivity, I believe Posh
Sidekick could be a perfect fit for you and your audience. Our mission is to
make Poshmark experience as seamless as possible, and empower sellers to
optimize time and efforts by using our app. Imagine having more time to source
unique pieces, list your items, accept offers, and make those sales. Most
importantly, more time for yourself to focus on what you do best which is
creating amazing content and inspiring your followers. Here are just a few of
the features you can expect to benefit from: - Self-Shares, Community Shares,
Follows - Offers to Likers and Relisting - Follow Back & Share Backs -
Background Remover Tool - Sales Reports - Automated Silent Shows And many
more... We believe your influence combined with Posh Sidekick's functionality
would be a great combination, and we'd love to invite you to try it out. If
you're interested to explore all these fantastic features, and know more about
our affiliate program, feel free to reach and we'd be more than happy to assist
you with it. Cheers to more sales, more engagement, and more time for yourself!
Best, Ana Posh Sidekick

Hi Kate, I am canceling my subscription because of several reasons. Sidekick
only does 400 follows in 24 hours and I am spending between 2-3 hours every
night following other people and closets. I pay for a bot so I dont have to do
this. Poshmark allows up to 10k a day in follows (same amount as shares) and the
people who follow you are the ones who see your feed. You follow, they follow
back. You need to have followers to be successful at Poshmark, its not just
about sharing. Also, I tried the Crosslisting and that was just a mess. I never
could connect to all my accounts like Depop, Etsy, etc. and the two accounts it
did connect to took way to much time to upload all the required information for
each listing. And I did reach out to support, but it was not successful. The bot
I was using prior to Sidekick does 10K shares and 10K follows in a 24 hour
period and includes Crosslisting (among other thing) that was much more user
friendly and connected easily to my other acounts. I wanted to try Sidekick
because it sounded really great and I was hopeful it would meet my needs and
help increase sales. But unfortunately that has not been the case for me. On a
side note, Sidekick does have an awesome customer service team and I appreciate
all the FB posts and updates from Michael and Erica! Perhaps in the future I
will give Sidekick another try. Kind regards, Stephanie McClain

with paymet 13:13 Customer S. joined the chat at 13:13 Customer S. 13:13 Hi
Negin, I'm Ana. Thank you for contacting us! Negin A. 13:13 Hi Ana Negin A.
13:14 Can you confirm if my account is active or not Customer S. 13:14 Please
let me check it. Customer S. 13:16 Please be advised to resubscribe through the
app as your payment for the renewal was unsuccessful. Negin A. 13:16 Yes Negin
A. 13:16 But is my account working now? Negin A. 13:18 It is sharing and sending
offers Negin A. 13:18 In the app showing that this account is active and next
payment due is end of this month Customer S. 13:19 Let me further check it.
Customer S. 13:23 Please log out and log in to your account. It's possibly not
showing the updated status of your subscription. Negin A. 13:24 It was inactive
since I couldn’t make the payment, then I called the bank they transferred me to
the security department and while I was waiting I noticed my posh sidekick is
activated and working Customer S. 13:27 It's because the app is still sharing

resubscribe. Negin A. 13:28 But it stopped sharing for 3 days and suddenly start
sharing against! Isn’t it weird??? Negin A. 13:28 Is that how this app works?
Customer S. 13:29 Yes, i understand that it's strange but I can assure that
sometimes there are glitches or bugs in which we don't have control over. And I
can assure you that what happened was unusual and is a possible glitch. Negin A.
13:30 Okay, that’s a good glitch, lol Thank you for your help Customer S. 13:31
You're most welcome, Negin! We appreciate your understanding! 13:31 Customer

Hello Glenda, Thank you so much for reaching out! I apologize for the
inconvenience. If your closet name is not working, please try linking it using
your Poshmark email address and password. If you still encounter the same issue,
please try to log out of the Sidekick app and then re-login. You will be
prompted to the closet linking screen by the app. To locate the logout option,
navigate to the profile page. Kindly don't use @ at the start of your closet
name and use a lowercase letter of your closet name. If you still encounter the
same issue, please let us know. I hope you find it useful. Have a great day!
Best Regards, Simon

Hi, No I can't seem to log in to the right thing. I'm honestly not sure if the
email I used to make my account was michellenoel_18@hotmail.com or something
else as I have two other gmail accounts as well. And then I tried to resset my
password and It did but now it only shows me one account and it says I'm on
trial. Do you know how I would fix it? Do I have to delete the whole account and
start again? I know it's up for renewal soon so hoping to get it sorted so I can
still use both accounts. Thanks Michelle

Hi Jen! Thank you for responding. I apologize for any confusion. Our manager has
instructed us to request 2 videos or reels every month. Additionally, you are
welcome to create videos that are not solely focused on Sidekick promotion, but
where you can insert promotions for Sidekick. I have created the coupon code
'PSKJEN10'. Please note that this code will expire after 2 months. It is
exclusive to resellers of Poshmark who have not yet availed of the subscription
on Sidekick before. Kindly share the link to your promotional video for Sidekick
once it has already been published on your YouTube channel. Let me know if you
have questions. Thank you so much! Best, Gail

can be reels or a video. If you'd like, we would be happy to create a 10%
discount coupon code for the first purchase of the Sidekick app that you can
offer to your audience for your promotional video. You can share the coupon code
along with your referral code. Let me know if you have questions. Thank you so

Hi Jen, Thank you for getting back to me. For our collaboration, we usually
request influencers to create dedicated videos, reels, or stories specifically
about the app. This approach allows for a more focused and detailed presentation
of Posh Sidekick's features and benefits, which can better resonate with your
audience. However, if you prefer to mention the app in your regular videos or
content, you can also do so but always include your referral code. Additionally,
I have added a 7-day free trial so you can explore the app for 2 weeks, and also
added 21 auction credits to your account. Please watch the video guide to set up
your first show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9nm18Ba_vA&t=56s

Pamela A. 09:48 Sidekick has stopped running twice this morning. I have not done
anything within the app today. This makes me very uncomfortable about Sidekick.
I do not want to lose my Poshmark account. 09:48 Customer S. joined the chat at
09:48 Customer S. 09:49 Hello Pamela, thank you for reaching out. Customer S.
09:49 This is Gail, I apologize for the inconvenience. Customer S. 09:49 Let me
check it one moment, please. Customer S. 09:58 Can I please ask if you can share
your listing manually? Kindly try to share one of your listings manually. Thank
you! Customer S. 09:59 Please inform us if you can share one of your listings.
Pamela A. 10:01 No I cannot manually share Customer S. 10:02 Upon further
checking, it appears that your account was soft-banned. However, please don't
worry, as the restriction for your closet will be lifted after some time.
Customer S. 10:02 This can occur if you manually share or add new items while
the app is already sharing your listings or if you exceed the daily limits set
by Poshmark. Customer S. 10:03 A soft ban means that your closet is temporarily
blocked from sharing or following by Poshmark due to excessive activity.
Customer S. 10:03 To prevent this from happening again, I suggest turning off
the sharing features of the app before sharing or adding new items to your
closet. Once you've finished sharing/adding items, you can then turn the sharing
feature back on. Pamela A. 10:06 This keeps happening. I have a very large
closet and I wasn’t doing anything in my closet when this occurred. It seems to
be something that Sidekick is doing to trigger this. Customer S. 10:08 I
apologize for the inconvenience. I will raise your concern with our technical
team. Customer S. 10:09 Once I have an update I will inform you through email.
Pamela A. 10:11 Thank you! Customer S. 10:13 You're most welcome! Thank you for
your patience and understanding. 10:42 Chat ended due to inactivity at 10:42

Hello Laura, Thank you so much for reaching out! I am sorry for the
inconvenience. Upon checking, your closet was on a soft ban. Please keep in mind
that it lasts for about 2–3 hours. To avoid a soft ban, do not share your closet
or add listings while the app is sharing. This is because Poshmark sometimes
considers this to be a high level of activity in your closet. Please avoid using
two sharing services at the same time. Please don't worry; your closet
restriction has been lifted, and your closet is now being shared. Please check
it out now. I hope you understand. Have a great day! Best Regards, Simon

you please let me know which platform you want to crosslist your Poshmark item?
You need to connect to the second marketplace where you want to crosslist your

Thank you. I finally got on. It took 5 hours. Now on the app. Poshmark is
connected but it doesn't list it. When I press (List to) it takes me to a
section that say Poshmark and it also says (disconn) I try and add Poshmark and
nothing happens. Also if you add hide optionals I thought Tabs says you fill out
all the details?? Not sure what is going wrong. I have never had so much trouble
with any of my Poshmark apps. I would like to get this going as soon as
possible. Thank you

Hi Margaret, Thank you for your response! We are happy that you accepted our
offer. I am pleased to inform you that 7 days has been added to your account,
and sharing has started for your closet. Kindly be advised to download the app
then log in, so you can log in to your account. Also, I have checked your
Settings and I noticed that you enabled the "Randomize OTL and Relist". I
suggest turning of this feature, as it adds extra delay in sending offers and
relisting of your items. You may try to select Share in Reverse in the share
options as well, to let the app share your closet from bottom to top according
to your listings order. Kindly refer to the below guide so you can explore the
app features and maximize it to boost your sales.

Hello Margaret, Thank you for sharing your experience with us, and we're glad to
hear that you found the relisting feature of Posh Sidekick amazing! We truly
appreciate your feedback and are sorry to hear that your sales went down during
the 7-day free trial period. It's important to note that every seller's
experience with Posh Sidekick can vary based on various factors, including the
size and nature of their closet, the types of items they sell, and external
market conditions. While some sellers may see an immediate increase in sales,
others may experience different outcomes. Regarding your concern about Poshmark
penalizing sellers for using third-party services, we want to assure you that
Posh Sidekick complies with all of Poshmark's policies and guidelines. Our app
is designed to enhance your selling experience on Poshmark, and we prioritize
the success and satisfaction of our users. We're sorry to hear about the issue
with offers for your jewelry category. It's great to hear that you found the
option to turn off offers for specific categories helpful. As a gesture of our
appreciation for your feedback and to offer you another opportunity to explore
the benefits of Posh Sidekick, we'd like to extend a special 30% discount on
your next purchase. Please reach out to us before making any purchases, and
we'll create an exclusive coupon code for you. Thank you once again for sharing

Hello, I tried Sidekick last week and it seemed like a miracle how it can relist
old listings. That is AMAZING. I LOVE THAT! But for some reason my sales went
down the week I tried sidekick. And most of the sales I did make were from an
existing customer that I had previously developed a relationship with. So, it
left me a bit worried that maybe Poshmark knew I was using a service (as I was
relisting/listing 20 or more items a day vs. my usually 3-5.) I wondered if
somehow they were penalizing me or if my experience was a fluke. So, I thought I
would just go back to my old way of handling my closet (that I am tired of.....)
to see if my sales go back up. So just sign me as a bit confused...as I have
heard other sellers saying their sales went through the roof within days of
trying your service. Thanks for the free week. I did think your app was quite
amazing. My only issue is that I had to turn off the offers for my jewelry, as I
have a lot of shoppers who "like" a lot of those items, then want to think about
what they want (they don't want offers right away) and then they come back later
to make me offers. But I like how I could turn offers off for that one category!
Thank you again for the free week. I am not sure what I should do at this
point.... Margaret Wilder

Hello Lisa, I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding
the concern you have reported and the technical team has an update. The app is
fetching your available items only for the next 5 days for relisting. Cannot
fetch not available items. If the app has already fetched the listing for
relisting, and you changed its status to NOT FOR SALE, the app will still relist
it as Poshmark allows Not For Sale items to be deleted and relisted. And because
the app has fetched the listing before as an available item. We suggest every
time you're going to change the status of your items, please check them also on
the View Upcoming Page for Relisting. You'll be able to view the list of
listings that are going to be relisted by the app for the next 5 days. If the
item is available there, you can remove it from the list so the app won't relist
it. You need to remove it after changing the listing status to not for sale. In
this way, the app won't relist the item and stop fetching the item for relist. I
hope this clarifies your concern. If you have any other questions or need
further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Gail

I want to check with you on the relist process to see if anything has changed
this week. All of a sudden on Poshmark I have 3 items that sold that were
already sold or showing as not for sale because it sold on another website. If
an item is in the que to be relisted does it check to see if while in que the
status changed. I have never had an issue before but this week I have resold 3
items that were previously sold either on poshmark or on another platform and I
manually make them not available if sold on another platform at the time of a
sale. Any thoughts because I am getting g ready to manually check all solds from
other platforms today to make sure they are not on poshmark, including deleting
my not for sales on poshmark.

Hello Brooke, Thank you for reaching out! Yes, if you’ve changed your username
on Poshmark, you’ll need to update that change in the app to ensure everything
is in sync. Here’s how you can do it: UNLINK - RELINK Go to Profile Page > Click
Switch Closet > Swipe left to Unlink > Then re-link your new closet This should
update your username in the app. If you have any other questions or need further
assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask. Kind regards, Mary

Hello Tracy, Thank you for reaching out! I’m sorry to hear about the issues
you’re experiencing with Posh Sidekick. This issue usually occurs when there
have been recent changes to your Poshmark account, such as updating your
password or changing your Poshmark closet name. To resolve this, you’ll need to
relink your closet to the app. Here’s how: UNLINK - RELINK Go to Profile Page >
Click Switch Closet > Swipe left to Unlink > Then re-link your new closet Once
you’ve done this, your items should start sharing again. If you continue to
experience issues, please let us know. We’re here to help! Best regards, Mary

Message: My Main page on Posh Sidekick where it says, "What is my closet doing
right now?" says "No item to share, check if your Poshmark Account is on
Vacation Mode." My closet is not on on vacation mode and my closet has not been
sharing at all. My listings are saying they haven't been shared in 23 days. Can
you help? My sales are DEAD because of this. --- Date: March 1, 2024 Time: 4:07

Hello Erica, Thanks for reaching out! We will surely inform our team to remove
it as it's not available in the app for now. Can you confirm if you tried to
fill out the form to check your closet score? It must be an automated email, and
I apologize for the confusion. Rest assured that we will inform the team about
it. Thank you! Best, Julia

Hello Erica, Thank you for reaching out! I’m sorry for the inconvenience you’re
experiencing. Unfortunately, the feature to check the Poshmark closet score was
removed by Poshmark on their website. As a result, we won’t be able to check it
anywhere. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please
don’t hesitate to ask. Best regards, Mary

Hi, I downloaded this and didn’t realize I was on a free week trial and never
logged on to test out the app. I sent you guys a email for the 30 day free trial
as I was using auto posher but it’s due for another month and don’t want to
purchase another month if i can try you guys out for 30 days. Please let me know
because my closet isn’t sharing at the moment and need to either get another
month with auto posher or hopefully try you guys out because I’m not impressed
with auto posher at the moment. Thank you , Brady

another try in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d be more than
happy to offer you a 30% discount on your next purchase. Plus, we’ll guide you

Hello Krista, Thank you for reaching out!  It’s not always urgent to update the
app, but it’s generally a good idea to do so as updates often include new
features and important bug fixes. You don’t need to delete and reinstall the
app. You can simply update it. Here’s how: 1. Open the App Store on your device.
2. Search for the Posh Sidekick app. 3. If there’s an update available, you’ll
see an Update button. Click on it to download the updated version. If there’s no
Update button, that means you already have the latest version of the app Please
let us know if you have any other questions or need further assistance. Best
regards, Mary

Hi Team, When I opened the app yesterday it suggested I get the updated app. Is
this urgent? Can I do updates instead or do I need to delete the app and
reinstall the app again from the app store? Thank you! Krista Bauer Threadboss

Hello Amanda, Thank you for reaching out! Upon checking, it appears there was a
duplicate subscription that triggered the double charge. Please rest assured, I
have canceled the duplicate subscription and processed a refund for $29.99. You
should receive the refund within 5-10 business days. 1-(1).png

Hello Jayne, I understand that you’re unable to provide a screenshot. No
worries. Upon checking, it appears that you’ve already created your
cross-listing account. If the app is still asking for credit card information,
there might be an option on the screen to skip this step. Please check and let

Hey Love2shop242, Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to reach out and say we're
big fans of your YouTube content ! We've got something exciting happening at

you: 1. Earn Big: Get a 15% commission on every referral for life! 2. Easy
Earnings: Make $0.50 for every free trial sign-up using your code. We're
offering you a two-week risk-free trial of Posh Sidekick, no obligations or

Hello ZsaZsa, Thanks for reaching out! Upon checking your account, it's now
shraring to party. Please try to refresh your app and check your activities.
Kindly be informed that a soft ban means that your closet is temporarily blocked
from sharing or following Poshmark due to excessive activity. This can happen if
you manually share using our service, add a listing while the app is sharing, or
exceed the daily limits set by Poshmark. This is not a serious issue, and it
does not mean your account is in danger. However, to prevent this from happening
again, we suggest turning off the self-share setting when you are planning to
work your closet manually. Let me know if you have any further concerns or
encounter the same issue so we can help you! Thank you! Best, Julia

gear cog icon ⚙️ > turn ON your services (flip the toggle). And watch Sidekick
do the rest! Here's a step-by-step video guide on how to turn on all the
automation: HERE

Hi Endy, Thank you for your email! Please be informed that unlinking your
account won't cancel your subscription, and it will remain active. This is the
reason that you were charged, as I have checked your subscription was cancelled
today only. image.png

However, please don't worry, a refund has been processed. Kindly note that it
may take 5-10 business days for funds to settle in your account. We look forward
to working with you again! Warm regards, Ana

Hello Gail, Thank you so much for reaching out and I apologize for being slow to
respond but I am simply swamped. At this time I am only focusing on paid
collaborations so if this is something you are considering, please let me know
what your budget is and what you are expecting from me. I am currently
successfuly using PosherVA and hopefully Posh Sidekick is better. I don't know
if you studied your competitor's features and personally I can not compare as I
did not use Posh Sidekick, I just know you're advancing and perfecting your app
faster and hopefully we can collaborate in the future. Thank you and looking

Hi Lorraine, Thank you for your email! My apologies for the inconvenience that
this has caused you. Please be informed that I have now processed a refund for
the duplicate subscription and payment of $23.99. Your next billing is on March
29, 2024, for $29.99. I just wanted to inform you that the cause of the other
charge is due to a duplicate subscription. I have canceled the duplicate
subscription to avoid other charges. The funds may take 5-10 business days to
settle in your account. Thank you so much! Best regards, Gail

Hello Lilly, Thank you for your feedback! As of now, it is not possible to
remove the ‘don’t send an offer’ setting from all items at once. However, I have
added your suggestion to our list for the technical team to review. We are
always looking for ways to improve our app and your feedback is invaluable in
this process. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please
don’t hesitate to ask. Have a great evening! Best regards, Dave

Hello Lilly, Thank you so much for the clarification! Please turn off the extra
setting you have set for the offer. You can simply remove the individual item's
setting and just keeo the default offer setting like, Item discount, shipping
discount, and time frame. If you are still confused and need our assistance,
plesae let me know. Havea great afternoon! Best Regards, Simon

Hi Simon. Sorry. Okay… a while back I did not want to send offers on certain
items (a lot in my closet actually) so I set them to dont offer. But now I DO
want to send offers and it appears the only way on the app is to do this
individually (which is really time consuming) and what i would rather do is just
have them all be able to have an offer sent. Then if I want to stop offers on
one particular item I could go ahead and do it. My closet has been real slow and
I want everything to have an offer without going in individually and allowing
it. Hope that clears the question up. Thanks for speedy response.
